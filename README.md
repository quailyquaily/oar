OAR (**O**pen **A**gent **R**untime) is a provider-independent programming interface for coding-agent runtimes: a solid foundation for building agent workspaces and other applications.

**Delete harness logic and focus on outcomes and UX.**

## Library

```ts
import { promptAndWait, runtimes } from "@botiverse/oar";

const grok = runtimes.require("grok");
const installation = await grok.installation?.();

if (installation?.kind === "available") {
  const session = await grok.session(installation, { cwd: process.cwd() });
  session.events((event) => {
    switch (event.kind) {
      case "text_delta": process.stdout.write(event.text); break;
      case "tool_call_started": console.log(`[${event.tool}]`); break;
      case "turn_ended": console.log(event.outcome.kind); break;
    }
  });
  const run = await promptAndWait(session, "Inspect this repository", { timeoutMs: 120_000 });
  console.log(run.kind === "rejected" ? run.code : run.outcome);
  await session.dispose();
}
```

`events()` is the flat, attributed reading of the session: one `Event` per
fact (native user message echoes, text, reasoning, background tasks, tool call
start / progress / end, turn start and end, usage, model, effort, compaction,
retry, app requests, control rejections, withdrawn inputs, the process exit),
with `seq` and `agentPath` on each. Pass `{ coalesceText: true }` to get text in blocks
instead of pieces. When the runtime's own frame matters, `session.rawEvents()`
and `session.records()` expose the underlying record stream with every native
payload verbatim. The [package README](packages/oar/README.md) lists the
public entry points.

`runtimes` holds every runtime but Cursor, whose SDK you install and hand
over: `createRuntimeRegistry([...runtimes.list(), createCursorRuntime({ sdk: () => import("@cursor/sdk") })])`
([why](docs/runtimes/cursor.md#installation-and-account-usage)).

## Handy utilities, no session needed

OAR also offers a set of handy utilities you can use without running an
agent at all: is it installed, which account and how much quota is left,
which models it can run, is there an update (and install it), what skills
and tools it has. One API covers every supported runtime, so a dashboard, a
setup wizard or a quota monitor needs no per-runtime code.

```ts
import { runtimes } from "@botiverse/oar";

for (const runtime of runtimes.list()) {
  const installation = await runtime.installation?.();
  if (installation?.kind === "available") {
    const [usage, models, update] = await Promise.all([
      runtime.accountUsage?.(installation),
      runtime.listModels?.(installation),
      runtime.checkUpdate?.(installation),
    ]);
    console.log(runtime.id, usage?.kind, models?.kind, update?.kind);
  }
}
```

- **Installation:** `installation()` finds the runtime on this machine and
  reports its version, with no account or network calls.
- **Account usage:** `accountUsage()` reads the plan and quota windows with
  their reset times (claude, codex, grok, kimi;
  [reference](docs/spec/account-usage.md)).
- **Models:** `listModels()` lists the models the installation can run now,
  with their effort levels; not being logged in is its own answer, not an
  empty list.
- **Updates:** `checkUpdate()` reports the version the runtime's own updater
  would install, and `upgrade()` runs that updater and judges it by the
  version afterwards ([reference](docs/spec/update.md)).
- **Inventories:** `skills()`, `mcpServers()` and `tools()` read what the
  runtime has configured natively ([reference](docs/spec/inventory.md)).
- **Session options:** `refusedSessionOptions` says which session options a
  runtime refuses, before anything opens; `session()` rejects them with an
  `UnsupportedOptionError` rather than drop them
  ([reference](docs/spec/runtime-matrix.md#refused-session-options)).

The CLI exposes the same queries: `oar installation`, `oar usage`,
`oar models`, `oar upgrade --check`, and `oar skills`, `oar mcps` and
`oar tools`.

## CLI

```bash
npx @botiverse/oar-cli list
oar run claude "What does this repo do?" --record run.jsonl
```

ESM-only, requires Node.js 24+, Apache-2.0.
