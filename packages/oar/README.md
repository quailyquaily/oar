# @botiverse/oar

Provider-independent TypeScript contracts and built-in implementations for controlling and observing Antigravity, Claude, Codex, Cursor, Grok, Kimi, and Pi.

```ts
import { promptAndWait, runtimes } from "@botiverse/oar";

const runtime = runtimes.require("grok");
const installation = await runtime.installation?.();

if (installation?.kind === "available") {
  const session = await runtime.session(installation, { cwd: process.cwd() });
  session.events((event) => {
    switch (event.kind) {
      case "text_delta": process.stdout.write(event.text); break;
      case "tool_call_started": console.log(`[${event.tool}]`); break;
      case "turn_ended": console.log(event.outcome.kind); break;
    }
  }, { coalesceText: true });
  const run = await promptAndWait(session, "Inspect this repository");
  console.log(run.kind === "rejected" ? run.reason : run.outcome);
  console.log(session.usage(), await runtime.accountUsage?.(installation));
  await session.dispose();
}
```

`session.events()` delivers flat, attributed `Event`s (native user message
echoes, text, reasoning, tool call start / progress / end, turn start and end,
usage, model, effort, compaction start / end, retry, background tasks and
subagents started, updated and ended, runtime→app requests and oar's answers,
control rejections, withdrawn inputs, the process exit), each carrying the
`seq` and `agentPath` of the record it was read from. Kinds a runtime never
says (claude has no compaction start, ACP runtimes and cursor no compaction,
only pi says retry) never appear; the runtime pages say which. It is a
projection over the record stream, which `session.rawEvents()` and
`session.records()` expose (`RawEvent`: `Frame` with the native payload
verbatim, `RequestRecord`, `ResponseRecord`) for consumers who need the
runtime's own frames.

`session.deliver(input, { when, origin })` sends input the host produces (a
subagent's result, a finished job) at the right moment: a new turn when the
session is idle, so the agent wakes, otherwise steered into the turn or queued
behind it. `origin` is recorded so a UI can tell it from typed input.
`session.steer` exists only on a session whose runtime can steer (kimi and
antigravity sessions have none), so a host offers a steer control by reading
the member, never a runtime name; `deliver` and `steerOrQueue` queue where it
is absent. `session.withdraw(inputId)` takes a queued input back before it is
sent (`accepted`), or answers `not_queued` once it went; with it a UI offers
withdraw, edit (withdraw, then `queue` again) and send now (withdraw, then
`deliver`). It exists where OAR holds the queue itself (claude, pi, cursor
and the ACP runtimes), not on codex, whose queue is its own.

For conversation UIs, use the browser-safe `reduceConversation` projection
over `session.rawEvents()`. It joins input requests, responses and native
echoes by identity, including steer → queue fallback. See the
[conversation contract](https://github.com/botiverse/oar/blob/main/docs/spec/conversation.md).

## Public exports

The package has six public entry points:

- `@botiverse/oar`: the runtime registry and adapters, `defineRuntime`, `UnsupportedOptionError`, the `oar-voyage/3` recorder (`openVoyage`), and everything the brands and observe entry points below export. Node-only (adapters import `node:child_process` and runtime SDKs).
- `@botiverse/oar/brands`: browser-safe runtime names and SVG icons.
- `@botiverse/oar/observe`: the browser-safe pure derivations over `RawEvent`s and `Event`s (`eventsOf`, `coalesceText`, `observeAgent`, `reduceStatus`, `tasksOf`, `observeStalls`, `classifyTool`, `reduceConversation`, `viewOf`, …) with no Node or adapter imports, so a browser or Electron-renderer bundle can import it directly. The root export re-exports all of them.
- `@botiverse/oar/kernel`: the runtime-author SPI. `createSessionKernel` is the record stream every built-in adapter is built on (dense `seq`, cursor replay, control recording, the reachability rule) and `sealSession` derives the `Session` API face over an adapter. Pair with `defineRuntime` to ship a custom runtime (a scripted runtime for a host's tests, an in-process agent) without re-implementing the stream contract. `inputImagesRefusal` and `withInputImages` are the image rules every built-in runtime keeps, so a custom runtime refuses the inputs they refuse. `withdrawHeld` is the decision behind `withdraw` for a runtime that holds its own queue.
- `@botiverse/oar/agents`: subagents. `createSubagents()` starts child sessions on any runtime that takes `SessionOptions.env` (not cursor), returns a report for every turn they end, takes follow-ups, enforces depth and concurrency limits, and reports each child as a task. The host takes reports with `wait` / `next` or receives them through an `onReport` hook; with `formatReport` and `reportOrigin` it can `deliver` one into a parent session so it wakes. See [subagents](https://github.com/botiverse/oar/blob/main/docs/spec/subagents.md). Node-only.
- `@botiverse/oar/testing`: `scriptedRuntime({ turn })`, a ready-made runtime on the kernel SPI whose model is a script. It yields a real `Session` (same records, folds and control semantics) with no binary, login or provider, for hosts' tests and demos. A script can also start tasks (`turn.task`) that end after the turn, like a background command. Node-only.

Brand SVG files are exported at `@botiverse/oar/assets/brands/<runtime-id>.svg`. Any other deep import (`@botiverse/oar/dist/...`, source paths) is internal and may break without notice.

Antigravity, Grok, and Kimi share an internal ACP v1 transport and session kernel, but only their concrete runtime identities are public. The registry deliberately does not expose a generic `acp` runtime. Pi and Cursor run in the host process through their SDKs. The pi SDK (`@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`) is a dependency of this package. `@cursor/sdk` is an optional peer dependency, and cursor is not in the built-in `runtimes` registry: install the SDK (`npm install @cursor/sdk@1.0.35`) and hand it over, `createRuntimeRegistry([...runtimes.list(), createCursorRuntime({ sdk: () => import("@cursor/sdk") })])`. Written in your code, that import fails your compile if the package is missing. It is Cursor's own package under Cursor's terms, and it signs in with `CURSOR_API_KEY` or its own `Cursor.auth.login()`.

Community runtimes are contributed and maintained outside the core team (each maintainer is named on its runtime page). They ship in this package from a separate entry point, `@botiverse/oar/community`, and are not in the built-in `runtimes` registry: `createRuntimeRegistry([...runtimes.list(), createMorphRuntime()])` adds [Mister Morph](https://github.com/botiverse/oar/blob/main/docs/runtimes/morph.md), driven through its Console Runtime API. The `oar` CLI includes them.

**Pi 1.0.3 Azure migration:** Pi renamed its provider from
`azure-openai-responses` to `azure`. Update that prefix in native provider
configuration and `SessionOptions.model`. When resuming an old Azure session,
explicitly pass `model: "azure/<model>"`; without it, Pi can retain the
conversation while selecting a different default model. The opening `model`
event and `Session.model()` report the effective selection. OAR's `^1.0.2`
dependency range already permits this upstream update. See the
[migration evidence and limits](https://github.com/botiverse/oar/blob/main/experiments/runtime-version-checks/2026-10-05.md).

The command-line interface is a separate package: `@botiverse/oar-cli`.

What a runtime cannot honor is refused, never dropped: `runtime.session()`
rejects with an `UnsupportedOptionError` (`option` names the refused
`SessionOptions` key, the message is the reason), so a host can try and fall
back on it. `runtime.refusedSessionOptions` names the options a runtime
refuses at open (`systemPrompt`, `appendSystemPrompt`, `env`), each with the
reason, so a host can leave them out before opening: cursor refuses all
three, kimi and antigravity the two prompt options. Kimi also refuses a
`resume` in another directory than the session's own (`option: "cwd"`). See
[refused session options](https://github.com/botiverse/oar/blob/main/docs/spec/runtime-matrix.md#refused-session-options).

`runtime.listModels(installation, options?)` lists the models an installation
can run now (`ok`, `unauthenticated` or `unsupported`); every built-in runtime
has it. `runtime.accountUsage(installation)` reads account quota on claude,
codex, grok and kimi; its failure semantics are in the
[account usage reference](https://github.com/botiverse/oar/blob/main/docs/spec/account-usage.md).

`runtime.checkUpdate(installation)` reports the version the runtime's own
updater would install and where that answer came from;
`runtime.upgrade(installation)` runs that updater without a terminal and
judges the result by the version the same executable reports afterwards,
never by its exit code. oar never upgrades on its own. Claude, Codex, Grok
and Kimi have both; Antigravity has only the check; Pi and Cursor have
neither, their SDK versions following oar's (Pi's SDK is a dependency,
Cursor's an exact peer dependency).
See [runtime updates](https://github.com/botiverse/oar/blob/main/docs/spec/update.md).

Images go with an input through `InputOptions.images` (`{ path }` entries:
absolute paths to png, jpeg, gif or webp files) on prompt, steer and queue,
as the runtime's own image content. `session.capabilities.images` says whether
the runtime takes them; an input it cannot deliver is rejected whole. See
[Images](https://github.com/botiverse/oar/blob/main/docs/spec/conversation.md#images).

TypeScript hosts: keep `skipLibCheck` on. With `skipLibCheck: false` and `module: nodenext`, importing `@botiverse/oar` alone reports errors inside the pi SDK's own declarations (`@earendil-works/pi-ai` imports JSON without an import attribute, TS1543); OAR's own declarations check clean. A host that installs `@cursor/sdk` and checks library files also needs the DOM lib for its `@connectrpc/connect` dependency (`HeadersInit`).

## Native inventories

Every runtime exposes `skills(installation, options?)`,
`mcpServers(installation, options?)`, and `tools(installation, options?)`.
Options are `{ cwd?: string, timeoutMs?: number }`; cwd defaults to
`process.cwd()`. Queries discover native information independently: they do
not inspect an existing Session or submit a model prompt, though native
startup can load extensions and connect configured MCP servers.

Results distinguish `ok`, `unsupported`, and `unavailable`. Successful results
contain `items`, `scope.cwd`, `observedAt`, `view`, and `partial`. A
`mcp-only` view excludes built-in tools. Unknown schema or state fields stay
absent, and an unsupported query never pretends to be an empty catalog.

Codex and Claude expose skills and MCP discovery (tools are MCP-only); Grok
exposes independent skills and MCP configuration discovery; Pi exposes skills
and registered tools with active membership. Antigravity, Cursor and Kimi
inventory queries are unsupported.

Custom runtimes should use `defineRuntime`, which fills missing inventory
methods with explicit unsupported results. A manually constructed `Runtime`
must implement the three methods.

### Runtime branding

`runtime.brand` contains `{ name, icon }`. Built-in icons are self-contained SVG
data URIs, usable as an `<img src>` offline and serializable across IPC.
Reading branding needs no installation, login, or runtime process. Browser-only
consumers can read it without loading native SDKs:

```ts
import { runtimeBrands } from "@botiverse/oar/brands";
const { name, icon } = runtimeBrands.claude;
```

The SVG files' attribution and licenses ship in `assets/brands/NOTICE.md`; Pi
uses the official `pi.dev` logo assets. Custom runtimes created with
`defineRuntime` may supply `brand`; otherwise it defaults to
`{ name: runtime.id, icon: null }`. Runtime branding identifies the provider
and is independent of an application's project avatars.

`brand.icons?.light` and `brand.icons?.dark` optionally override the default
for light and dark **backgrounds**; they need not be distinct or both present.
`runtimeBrandIcon(brand, theme)` returns the matching variant, falling back to
`brand.icon` (null for brands without artwork). Hosts choose the theme from
their own surface, not necessarily the operating system setting.

```ts
import { runtimeBrands, runtimeBrandIcon } from "@botiverse/oar/brands";
const src = runtimeBrandIcon(runtimeBrands.codex, "dark");
```
