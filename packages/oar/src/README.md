these contracts, see [`docs/runtimes/`](../../../docs/runtimes/README.md).

- Simple capabilities use one behavior contract; add separate API/SPI contracts only when abstraction level or call direction differs. Say "runtime X passed the behavior tests", not "conformance": one word, no ceremony.
- `runtimes/<id>/index.ts` declares that runtime's supported capabilities. Keep its parsing, compatibility policy, and protocol details nearby.
- Keep host dependencies as constructor inputs until multiple runtimes prove a stable shared boundary. Do not create empty architecture directories.
- Test layers (`tests/`, `sea-trial/`, `experiments/`) are described in [`docs/development.md`](../../../docs/development.md#how-to-validate-the-changes).
- Installation probing is local-only. Account usage is a separate authenticated observation capability.
- Behavior invariants live as comments on the exact contract member they constrain; every must/never has (or gets) a sea-trial case.
- The agent-facing dependency direction is discovery/capabilities → control →
  records → observe → continue. Keep host policy and persistence outside the
  package; see [`docs/design/system.md`](../../../docs/design/system.md).
