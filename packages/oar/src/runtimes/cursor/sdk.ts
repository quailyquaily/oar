/*
 * The part of `@cursor/sdk` (1.0.35) the adapter uses, narrowed so tests can
 * stand in for it. The SDK runs Cursor's agent in this process: a local
 * agent keeps its conversation under `~/.cursor/projects/<cwd>/`, and its
 * credential is `CURSOR_API_KEY` or the key `Cursor.auth.login()` stored.
 *
 * The SDK is an optional peer dependency the host installs, so these types
 * are written out here rather than imported: OAR's published declarations
 * must not name a package a host may not have. The host hands the module
 * over (`createCursorRuntime({ sdk: () => import("@cursor/sdk") })`), and
 * its compile checks the real module against `CursorSdk`; in this repo the
 * CLI and the sea trial do, so its typecheck catches drift.
