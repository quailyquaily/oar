/*
 * Cursor through `@cursor/sdk` (1.0.35), in process (settled 2026-10-03,
 * replacing cursor-agent ACP): a session is one local SDK agent, its id the
 * SDK's `agent-<uuid>`; a turn is one `send`, from the run it returns until
 * `run.wait()` answers; steer is `run.steer`; abort is `run.cancel`; the
 * agent takes one run at a time (a second `send` is refused "already has
 * active run"), so queued input is held here and sent when the run ends.
 * The agent's store keeps its last run as active until that run's own
 * agent object ends it, so after a process that died mid-run, or a session
 * closed before its first prompt, a resumed agent refuses every send the
 * same way (probed 2026-10-03); the first send after a resume is `force`d,
 * which takes the agent over. Arbitrating between processes is the host's.
