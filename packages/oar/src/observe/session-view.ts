/**
 * The chat-UI projection: one `SessionView` is everything a conversation
 * surface needs — grouped messages, agent status, model/usage/context, and
 * the runtime requests still awaiting an answer. Pure over the record
 * stream (docs/design/chat-ui.md): replayable from a log, no clock, no IO.
 *
 * Grouping rules, all derived never synthesized:
 * - A TURN is a display segment: it opens on its prompt request or on the
 *   first turn-content event while none is open (adopted: queued input
 *   consumed, mid-turn subscriber, replay slice). A rejected prompt removes
 *   its empty turn — the turn never began (same rule as `reduceStatus`).
 *   `turn_ended` of the ROOT session stamps the open segment; an input
 *   entering mid-turn seals the current segment so seq order stays the
 *   render order, and later content opens a new segment.
 * - An INPUT enters where the runtime took it. A prompt enters at its
 *   request (it opens its turn). A steer or queue enters at its first native
 *   echo (`user_message` with its `inputId`) when the stream echoes input
 *   ids at all, which it shows by having echoed one before (codex, claude);
 *   until then it waits in `pendingInputs`. On a stream that never echoed
 *   one (pi, cursor, ACP runtimes) it enters at its request, the best fact known. A
 *   refused input enters where it was refused; a retry of it that must wait
 *   for its echo takes it back out. A withdrawn input leaves `pendingInputs`
 *   and `messages`; the segment its request sealed stays sealed.
 * - A SECTION is a contiguous run of one lane (`sessionId`, `agentPath`)
 *   inside a turn. Sub-agent and child-session activity nests inside the
 *   parent turn as sections; a child session's own `turn_ended` degrades
 *   to a notice part, it never closes the root turn.
 * - A TOOL part is one per lane and callId: a progress or end settles it in
 *   the turn its start landed in, even after that turn ended; only a call
 *   whose start was never seen becomes a `?` part.
 * - An exited stream never stamps a fabricated outcome on an open turn.
