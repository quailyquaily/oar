 * Session contract: one ordered, resumable record stream.
 *
 * The external promise (docs/spec): everything the runtime said is in the
 * stream, nothing oar didn't observe is in it, every record knows whose it
 * is, and the stream is readable again from any position. Records split by
 * OBLIGATION into three kinds, frame (the runtime's own words), request (an
 * action that expects an outcome) and response (points at a request), and
 * travel on one channel with one monotonic `seq`. Consumers who do not want
 * records read the stream as flat `Event`s through `events()`; `rawEvents()`
 * and `records()` are the stream itself. Behavior invariants live as
 * comments on the member they constrain; each "must/never" has (or gets) a
 * sea-trial case.
 *
 * Scope notes that fit no single member:
 * - Ownership is the object reference; no in-process lease. Multi-controller
 *   arbitration belongs to the application layer.
 * - Sessions run YOLO by default: adapters disable interactive permission
 *   gates (claude --dangerously-skip-permissions, codex approvalPolicy
 *   never, pi pre-trusted cwd, ACP allow_always) AND default sandboxes off
 *   (codex danger-full-access, cursor sandboxOptions.enabled false;
 *   claude/pi have none). In embedded use nobody sits at an approval
 *   prompt: a gate is a hang, not safety. A host wanting isolation opts in
 *   (OAR_CODEX_SANDBOX). Runtime→app requests that DO
 *   arrive are recorded verbatim (direction "toApp") and oar's automatic
 *   answer, when it gives one, is the matching response record.
 * - The cursor is honored for the lifetime of the adapter process: a
 *   subscriber reconnecting with `afterSeq` misses nothing and repeats
 *   nothing. `SessionOptions.resume` reopens the runtime-native conversation
 *   with a fresh stream starting at seq 0.
