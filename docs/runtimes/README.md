# Runtime knowledge

The subject is each runtime's **programming interface for calling an agent**:
which operation to call, with what input and identity, what its result means,
and what the caller can observe or control afterward. Native concepts explain
those contracts; internals matter where they explain API behavior.

These pages connect **native concepts and calling surfaces → high-level OAR
mapping → per-feature details and evidence**. They serve abstraction design as
well as adapter maintenance, so a runtime can be useful design input even when
it is not an OAR backend or prospective consumer.

## Pages

Daily maintenance: [version inventory and latest probe results](../../experiments/runtime-version-checks/2026-10-05.md).
Run `pnpm tsx experiments/runtime-versions.ts` to compare stable releases
with the installed CLIs, bundled Pi SDK and host-supplied Cursor SDK before
selecting live probes.

Cross-runtime investigations:

- [Steer, queue and cancellation](input-cancellation.md) (local probes without model turns, 2026-09-16): native withdrawal surfaces, adapter-held queues, abort semantics.
- [Resume in another directory](resume-cwd.md) (live, 2026-10-03): which runtimes keep a conversation when it moves to another working directory, and which refuse.
- [Steer delivery](steer-delivery.md) (scripted-provider probes, 2026-09-16): what each runtime echoes for a steer and how the echo correlates with the input.
- [Native skills, MCP and tool inventories](inventory.md) (local probes, 2026-09-16): what each runtime's own discovery calls return.
- [Live model and effort changes](live-configure.md) (local probes, 2026-09-29): native setters that change a running session without a restart, and the adapter queues they meet.
- [Runtime updaters](update.md) (sandbox probes, 2026-10-01): how each runtime updates itself and how its updater can claim success without upgrading.
- [Crash and resume](crash-resume.md) (live probes, 2026-10-02): what claude, codex and pi keep when the process tree dies mid tool call, and what they do by themselves on reopen.

Live-probe investigations of runtimes without an adapter live under
[`investigations/`](investigations/README.md): currently
[opencode](investigations/opencode.md) and [goose](investigations/goose.md).
They are reference only and follow the same evidence conventions.

Each page records its own native source, documentation and observed binary
versions (first review 2026-09-08, OAR `9b102d0`). Those versions are evidence
baselines, not a declared support range.

## Read the mappings precisely

These are documentation labels, not a capability API:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Mapped / supported | The current adapter implements the stated operation. Read its limits and verification evidence; the label is not a universal compatibility claim. |
| Partial / projected | OAR carries some of the native behavior or information. The page names what is transformed, omitted, or constrained. |
| Not exposed / unexposed | The native feature exists, but there is no corresponding public OAR operation or record. Native configuration may still affect execution. |
| Unavailable on selected transport | The underlying runtime has information or control that the interface selected by OAR does not expose. Separate this from information OAR itself drops. |
| Unverified | The stated semantic guarantee has not been established by the cited evidence. An implemented method can still have an unverified interpretation. |
| Reference only | Design input from a runtime without a current OAR integration. Comparisons do not imply an implementation plan. |

Keep three layers distinct in every capability row: what the native runtime
can do, what its selected interface reveals, and what OAR actually carries.
Native session persistence does not imply OAR history replay; a
`contextUsage()` method does not prove that cumulative token counts measure
current context occupancy.

## Evidence discipline

- **Native source or official documentation** establishes the native model
  and advertised protocol. Pin source revisions where possible; date rolling
  documentation and identify the relevant interface.
- **OAR implementation** establishes today's mapping. Follow executable paths
  rather than trusting an old comment or inferring support from a type alone.
- **Recorded observation** establishes what happened on the named version,
  configuration, and probe. Link the experiment or fixture and preserve its
  limits; do not silently generalize to a later binary.
- **Tests** establish particular assertions at a particular seam. Distinguish
  fake process/SDK fixtures, real runtime with a scripted model, and real
  authenticated calls. A test file or CI configuration is not a fresh pass.
- **Open questions and design implications** remain visibly separate from
  facts. Do not turn an attractive inference into a native guarantee.

## Questions each page should answer

1. What does the runtime own? Which objects have distinct identity, lifetime,
   persistence, and authority: process, session, thread, turn, run, item,
   request, tool call, child agent?
2. How does a program connect and call the agent: SDK, process protocol, or
   RPC? What are the concrete operations, inputs, results, errors, and
   asynchronous events? Which are public entry points versus internal APIs?
3. Which native interfaces expose those concepts, and which one does OAR use?
   What capabilities depend on version, configuration, extensions, or trust?
4. How does each native capability map into today's public contract? Include
   control, observation, interaction, history, tools, configuration, usage,
   and resource release; name missing capabilities explicitly.
5. Which distinctions must an abstraction preserve? What does an
   acknowledgement prove? Who owns retries or execution? What can be
   reconstructed from records, and what remains unknown?
6. What evidence validates those claims, and which focused probe would settle
   the most consequential remaining uncertainty?

For **resume**, always distinguish: which token is persisted and where it is
valid; whether the call loads history, attaches to running work, starts a
continuation, or replays events; whether new prompt submission is separate;
what configuration is restored or overridden; and what happens on missing
identity, concurrent controllers, or an ambiguous response. Do not infer one
guarantee from another because the method is named `resume`.

Page structure:

1. **Native concepts and calling interfaces.** The runtime's own objects and
   lifetimes, then the available SDK/CLI/protocol entry points.
2. **High-level mapping to OAR.** How native objects, identities, control,
   and observation correspond to OAR, small enough to orient the reader
   before individual operations.
3. **Capability details.** Separate subsections for creation/resume,
   prompt/steer/queue, cancellation/release, events/history/children,
   models/context, tools/permissions, and other relevant features. Each
   connects the native API, OAR mapping, limits, and evidence.
4. **Evidence and verification.** Source/observed versions, existing tests,
   and unresolved questions. A short review baseline may appear at the top;
   it should not displace the conceptual introduction.

Keep broader runtime design brief and tied to caller-visible behavior. Do not
force every runtime into an identical internal taxonomy or reproduce its
entire manual. Reference-only pages use the same outline and mark the OAR
comparison explicitly as unimplemented.

## Where this fits and how to maintain it

[`../design/`](../design/README.md) records OAR's design reasoning;
[`../spec/`](../spec/README.md) is the record-stream contract the adapters
implement. These runtime pages record native facts and **current
implementation** (which native frames become which records and events, which
controls are which requests, what each adapter declares in `capabilities`)
and may expose reasons to revisit either. A contract guarantee is not
evidence that a particular adapter honors it live; the evidence sections say
what was verified. [`experiments/`](../../experiments/README.md) keeps
reproducible live probes; [`sea-trial/`](../../sea-trial/README.md) explains
ongoing behavior validation; the [source index](../../packages/oar/src/README.md)
identifies implementation ownership.

When an adapter change, dependency upgrade, or probe changes a mapping, update
its page in the same commit. Preserve uncertainty until new evidence resolves
it; replace stale conclusions rather than building a chronological diary.
Adding a runtime page updates this index and the root knowledge index.
Follow the [development workflow](../development.md) for implementation and
validation; these pages inform that work and do not replace its tests.
