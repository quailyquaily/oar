# Codex

Evidence baseline: native source pinned to [`4f39251a`][native-source]
(2026-08-22) unless a claim cites the newer upstream tree
[`2151d3a5`][upstream-tree] (2026-09-12); the [app-server guide][guide] is
rolling documentation. The OAR mapping was checked against source on
2026-10-05. Live observations come from **codex-cli 0.154.0**
(`gpt-5.3-codex-spark`, ChatGPT login, darwin) through
[`experiments/live-contract.ts codex`](../../experiments/live-contract.ts)
(13 scenarios, 2026-09-11), from
[`experiments/codex-child-threads.ts`](../../experiments/codex-child-threads.ts)
on **0.149.0**, and from the probes (handshake, steering/abort, model listing,
resume/model readback) in the [experiments index](../../experiments/README.md);
later observations name their own version. Versions are evidence baselines,
not a support range; a claim that holds only on a named binary is marked
[env]. See the [runtime index](README.md) for evidence and status conventions.

## Native concepts and calling interfaces

Codex owns the agent loop, tools, model context, persistence, and policy
enforcement. Its core execution model is **Thread → Turn → Item**. A request
acknowledgement, a streamed item, and a completed turn answer different questions.

| Concept | Native meaning |
|---|---|
| Thread | Persistent conversation identity, configuration, history, and loaded execution state. |
| Turn | An execution episode with native ID and terminal status; it may contain many model/tool steps. |
| Item | A typed message, reasoning block, tool invocation, compaction, collaboration operation, etc. Item IDs join lifecycle events and deltas. |
| Request / notification | RPC replies acknowledge operations; notifications report execution. Server-initiated requests require client replies. |
| Subagent | Collaboration refers to other threads and their states, with identities separate from the parent turn and its tool items. |

| Surface | Calling model |
|---|---|
| CLI | Interactive terminal use and noninteractive `codex exec` execution. |
| TypeScript SDK | Wraps the CLI. `startThread()` / `resumeThread(id)` return a Thread; `run()` buffers a result and `runStreamed()` exposes events. |
| Python SDK | Exposes a `Codex` client, thread operations, runs, streaming, and workspace controls. |
| App-server | Bidirectional protocol for thread/turn control, notifications, and server-initiated interactions. **This is OAR's selected interface.** |

See the pinned [thread schema][thread-schema], [item schema][item-schema],
[TypeScript SDK][ts-sdk], [Python SDK][python-sdk], and the rolling
[app-server guide][guide]. SDK behavior must not be substituted for the
app-server contract merely because operation names resemble each other.

## High-level mapping to OAR

OAR starts one `codex app-server` process per Session, speaks app-server
protocol version 2 over stdio, and exposes it as the
[record stream](../spec/README.md): every notification is one Frame record
(params verbatim in `native`, OAR's reading in `events`), every control call is
a request record answered by the RPC reply, and codex's own `turn/completed`
ends the turn. The adapter declares `capabilities: { queue: { durable: true
}, attribution: "nested", images: true }`; the session has `steer` and no
`withdraw` ([queue](#prompt-steering-queueing-and-abort)).

| Native concept or boundary | Current OAR mapping |
|---|---|
| Thread identity | `Session.id` is the native thread id. The `thread/start` / `thread/resume` reply is the open Frame record (`type` = the method), carrying the `model` event (and `effort` when codex reports a level). Frames codex sends before that reply (notifications and server requests alike) are recorded ahead of it in wire order, and frames written after it (`thread/started`) follow it whatever the chunking. |
| Native turn | No OAR turn object. The turn starts at the `prompt` request record and ends at codex's `turn/completed` (`turn_ended`: `completed`; `interrupted` → aborted; any other status → failed, with the preceding `error` notification's detail appended). The native turn id rides every turn-scoped notification as `spanId` and is the precondition for steer and interrupt. |
| Items and notifications | One frame per notification, nothing dropped: `item/agentMessage/delta` → `text_delta` (`messageId` = `itemId`, the agentMessage item); `rawResponseItem/completed` reasoning → `reasoning`; `userMessage` items → `user_message`; `commandExecution` / `fileChange` / `mcpToolCall` / `webSearch` / `sleep` items → `tool_call_started` / `tool_call_ended` with the item type as `tool` and the item id as `callId` ([outcomes](#tool-call-outcome-reporting); a `sleep` is the model waiting, its input `{durationMs}` the wait it asked for, which a steer can end early, and `classifyTool` reads it as a `wait`); `item/commandExecution/outputDelta` → `tool_call_progress` (`callId` = `itemId`, `output` = the delta) [env 0.154.0 schema]; `contextCompaction` items → `compaction_started` / `compaction_ended`; `item/completed` for `subAgentActivity` items → task events; `thread/tokenUsage/updated` → `usage`; `thread/settings/updated` → `model` / `effort`; everything else is a frame with no events. No `retry` event: codex exposes no retry notification. |
| Control replies | The `turn/start`, `turn/steer`, `turn/interrupt` and `thread/queue/add` replies are the `accepted` / `rejected` responses to prompt / steer / abort / queue, with the reply as `native` (so the queue submission id is retained). Each response is recorded as the reply line is read, before notifications codex wrote after it. |
| Effective configuration | `model()` and `effort()` fold the `model` / `effort` events of the open reply and of `thread/settings/updated` ([models](#models-instructions-and-context)). Most native configuration has no public mutator. |
| Server requests | Recorded as `toApp` request records (method and params verbatim, the server's own id), never answered: `approvalPolicy: never` means none are expected, and one that arrives stays dangling. `events()` reads each as `app_request` with the method as `type`; no `app_answered` follows. |
| Native children | Notifications of another thread are child-session records (`sessionId` = that thread id, a `graph()` node); a collaboration item naming `receiverThreadIds` / `agentThreadId` adds a `tool_call` edge from the sender thread; without such an item no edge is fabricated ([children](#observation-children-and-history)). |
| Process and observation lifetime | The Session owns its process; `dispose` is a request answered by the observed `exited` response (also recorded, pointing at no request, when the app-server dies on its own). The retained log backs the cursor for this process's lifetime; a resume starts a fresh stream at seq 0. |

read-back][oar-open], [projection][oar-projection], [kernel][oar-kernel], and

## Capability details

### Connection, session creation, and resume

OAR launches `codex app-server -c sandbox_mode="…" --listen stdio://` (see
[tools and permissions](#tools-permissions-and-client-callbacks)), sends
`initialize` (`clientInfo: { name: "oar" }`, `capabilities: { experimentalApi:
true }`), then the `initialized` notification; request ids correlate replies.
New sessions call `thread/start { cwd, model?, approvalPolicy: "never",
experimentalRawEvents: true, baseInstructions?, developerInstructions?,
config?: { model_reasoning_effort } }`. OAR requires a thread id in the reply,
and a model and effort readback matching any explicit request, before
constructing its Session; otherwise it kills the process and throws (an RPC
failure reads `codex thread/start failed: <message>`).

The app-server talks before the thread exists ([env] 0.154.0):
`remoteControl/status/changed { status: "disabled", serverName,
installationId, environmentId: null }` follows the `initialize` reply in every
run and is seq 0, the open event is seq 1, and `thread/started` (root
`parentThreadId: null`) follows
([pre-open tests](../../tests/codex/codex-pre-open.test.ts)). An unknown model
slug opens and fails only at the first turn
([models](#models-instructions-and-context)).
[Adapter][oar-session], [transport][oar-transport],
[handshake probe](../../experiments/codex-handshake.ts).

**Resume.** The native call:

```text
thread/resume { threadId: savedThreadId, cwd, model? }
  → { thread: { id, turns, ... }, model, cwd, ...effectiveConfiguration }
```

It loads persisted conversation state or attaches to a thread already loaded
in that server; it does not submit a prompt (that is `turn/start`). The result
includes effective configuration and history, with native options to exclude
or page turns. Resume success is not turn completion, and returned history is
not replayed as live notifications. The pinned schema's experimental
history/path inputs are not exposed. [Resume schema][resume-schema].

**Mapped:** `codexRuntime.session(installation, { cwd, resume: savedSessionId,
model? })` sends `thread/resume { threadId, excludeTurns: true, cwd, model?,
approvalPolicy: "never", …instructions }`, requires a thread id, checks an
explicit `model` against the readback, and sets a differing effort afterwards
([effort](#models-instructions-and-context)). The token is a native thread id
resolved against the selected executable's runtime storage and configuration
(`CODEX_HOME`), not a portable transcript; a resume naming another `cwd` kept
the conversation and ran its shell there (0.160.0,
[resume in another directory](resume-cwd.md)). The resumed session keeps the
id and gets a fresh stream at seq 0: what the app-server said while loading
comes first ([env] 0.154.0: `remoteControl/status/changed`, `warning`, four
`mcpServer/startupStatus/updated`, `thread/status/changed idle`), then the
`thread/resume` reply as the open event at seq 7, and the model recalls the
earlier transcript (live-contract `resume`). With `excludeTurns` no history
is replayed into the stream; no cursor from the previous process is valid,
and nothing restores observer positions or a controller lease. The first
`turn/start` after resume is preceded by a `thread/tokenUsage/updated`
carrying the previous turn's id and the thread's cumulative total, then
`thread/goal/cleared` ([env] 0.154.0); totals accumulate across processes, so
`usage()` on a resumed session includes earlier turns. Resume sends no
`experimentalRawEvents`, which would be inert there
([reasoning](#observation-children-and-history)).

A thread whose rollout was never written (no turn yet) cannot be resumed
([session identity](#matrix-columns), [floors](#resumability-floors)).
Missing or unloadable threads reject as `codex thread/resume failed:
<message>`; structured RPC error data is dropped. A `thread/resume` on a
connection already subscribed to the loaded thread drops the `model` override
and reports the old model, so the adapter refuses a readback mismatch
(killing the app-server it started) rather than run silently on another
model; the override applies on a cold load, the normal case since every
Session owns its process. OAR does not arbitrate independent controllers
resuming the same persisted identity.

[error handling][oar-transport].

### Prompt, steering, queueing, and abort

**Prompt (mapped):** native `turn/start { threadId, input }` returns
`{ turn: { id } }`; later notifications establish completion. `prompt(string)`
records a `prompt` request, sends the text input, and records the RPC reply
as the `accepted` response. It is `rejected` with the RPC error message, with
`codex turn/start returned no turn id` when the reply names none, or `busy`
while a root turn is active (a queued turn codex started on its own
included). Completion is codex's
`turn/completed`, exactly one `turn_ended` per prompt (live-contract
`multi-turn`). A basic one-word turn was 33 records with event kinds `model,
reasoning, text_delta, usage, turn_ended`, one `spanId`, dense seqs, every
frame carrying `native`, and `dispose` answered `exited { code: null }`
(live-contract `basic`). No skill input, structured-output schema, or per-turn
configuration is exposed. [Adapter][oar-session].

**Images (mapped):** `InputOptions.images` follow the text as `{ type:
"localImage", path }` items on `turn/start`, `turn/steer` and
`thread/queue/add`, the order codex's own composer sends; codex reads the file
and sends it upstream as an `input_image` data URL
([vendor test](../../sea-trial/vendor/images.vendor.test.ts); live with
codex-cli 0.155.1, 2026-09-29: a plain green PNG named `probe.png` was
answered `green`). OAR checks the file's type and readability first, so a bad
image refuses the input before any RPC.

**Input identity:** every prompt, steer and queue sends its `inputId` (a UUID,
assigned when the host gives none) as `clientUserMessageId`; codex echoes it as
the `userMessage` item's `clientId`, read on `item/started` as a
`user_message` event with that `inputId`. Acceptance and native observation
remain separate from model consumption. The
[conversation contract](../spec/conversation.md) specifies the echo mapping,
the steer → queue fallback, and the limits of acknowledgement evidence; the
[steer delivery probes](steer-delivery.md) hold the native observations.

**Steer (mapped, landing observed):** native `turn/steer { threadId,
expectedTurnId, input, clientUserMessageId }` binds input to the expected
active turn, so codex adjudicates the race; OAR supplies the native turn id
it retained from the `turn/start` reply or the latest root `turn/started`.
The `{ turnId }` reply is the `accepted` response (delivery ownership, not
model attention); every RPC error is `rejected runtime_refused` with a reason
prefixed `not_steerable:` (operational failures included), and with no
active turn the gate answers `no_active_turn` (`not_steerable: no active
turn`). A steer accepted while the turn's first tool ran appeared as a
`userMessage` item inside the same turn and shaped its final text (`ALPHA
BRAVO MANGO`), with one `turn_ended` (live-contract `steer`;
[adapter probe](../../experiments/codex-session-adapter.ts)).

**Instant interrupt (opt-in, observed on 0.159.0):** native `[features]
instant_interrupt = true` (off by default, under development upstream) makes
`turn/steer` preempt an unfinished model response or yield a running
code-mode cell early. OAR inherits the configuration and keeps its mapping
and default. The same native turn continues, the cell is not stopped, direct
tool calls still finish before new input is sampled, queue stays a next-turn
operation and abort still ends the turn. Partial deltas of the interrupted
assistant item can remain without an `item/completed`; Codex excludes them
from the replacement model context, and OAR keeps them as observations, not
committed transcript evidence
([seven-case probe, opt-in instructions and limits](../../experiments/codex-instant-interrupt.md)).

**Queue (mapped, `durable: true`):** native queue operations have submission
identities and inspection/editing methods. `queue()` calls `thread/queue/add
{ threadId, input, clientUserMessageId }` and keeps the reply
(`queuedSubmission { id, input, clientUserMessageId }`) as the accepted
response's `native`; inspection and editing are not exposed. Codex emits
`thread/queue/changed` at add and at drain, and the drained turn is
spontaneous: `turn/started` … `turn/completed` with no prompt request of its
own, its `userMessage` item carrying `clientId` = the submitted
`clientUserMessageId` (live-contract `queue`,
[queue probe](../../experiments/session-queue.ts)). The adapter adopts such a
turn as busy. A queued submission survived a SIGKILL of the whole process
tree and ran by itself as a new turn on resume, before any prompt (codex
0.158.0, one run, [crash and resume](crash-resume.md)), so a prompt sent
right after such a resume is rejected `busy` until that turn ends; a steer
accepted but not yet read when the process died was lost in the same run.
[Thread schema][thread-schema].

**Withdraw (not exposed):** the session has no `withdraw`. The queue is codex's
own, and its `thread/queue/delete` is experimental and not live-verified (its
`deleted: false` cannot tell "already dispatched" from "never there"), so OAR
does not claim it ([input cancellation](input-cancellation.md)).

**Abort (mapped):** native `turn/interrupt { threadId, turnId }` targets an
execution; `turn/completed` reports whether the interrupt won the race.
`abort()` records an `abort` request; the interrupt reply (`{}`) is its
`accepted` response, and an RPC error (the turn already finished) is a
`rejected` response with the runtime's message: a recorded race, not a
swallowed error. The outcome is `turn/completed`'s status, `interrupted` →
`aborted`. The reply is recorded after the frames codex wrote meanwhile (the
raw `function_call_output` `"Wall time: 2.2 seconds\naborted by user"`, a
usage update, rate limits), then `turn/completed { status: "interrupted",
items: [] }`; the interrupted `commandExecution` item gets no
`item/completed`, so its `tool_call_started` has no `tool_call_ended`
(live-contract `abort`). A second prompt during a turn is `rejected: busy`;
with nothing active, including after the turn, an abort is `rejected: no
active turn` and a steer `rejected: not_steerable: no active turn`
(live-contract `busy-and-late-control`;
[stream tests](../../tests/codex/codex-session-stream.test.ts)).

**Dispose and unreachable runtime:** `dispose()` records a `dispose` request,
kills the app-server and awaits its exit, recorded as the `exited` response
(signal death: `code: null`). OAR does not settle active work: a dispose
mid-tool ends with `tool_call_started`, `dispose`, `exited { code: null }` and
no `turn_ended`, so the exit is the turn end for observers and `turnEndAfter`
reads `failed: runtime exited` (live-contract `dispose-mid-turn`). Dispose
releases the process; it establishes no exclusive control over persisted
history. When the app-server dies on its own (SIGKILL mid-tool) the stream
gets `exited { code: null }` with `requestId: ""`; every later
prompt/steer/queue/abort is `rejected: runtime exited`, and a later
`dispose()` is answered `accepted`, nothing being left to release
(live-contract `kill-runtime`). Both reachability answers (`runtime exited`,
`session disposed`) are the shared kernel's, read off the stream before the
adapter's own gates; the adapter keeps no liveness flag. [Kernel][oar-kernel].

### Observation, children, and history

**Mapped:** native thread read/list/fork operations expose stored state, and
resume can return history; OAR exposes none of those and does not hydrate the
stream from the resume result. Every notification enters the stream verbatim
(`native` is the params object) with a session-local `seq`, ingress
`receivedAt`, and the native turn id as `spanId`; `rawEvents(observer,
{ sessionId, afterSeq })` replays the retained records of this process, then
continues live. A mid-turn subscribe's replay plus live delivery is contiguous
with the log, and a full replay equals `records()` (live-contract `cursor`).
There is no cross-process cursor, catch-up from codex's rollout, or
backpressure. The guide marks rollback deprecated; OAR does not expose it.

**Tool detail** (live-contract `tool-detail`): a `commandExecution` item
yields `tool_call_started` with the command as input (`/bin/zsh -lc 'echo …'`)
and `tool_call_ended` with the aggregated output and the item's `exitCode`,
same `callId` (the item id, `call_…`); the raw `function_call` names
`exec_command`; `item/commandExecution/outputDelta` frames carry the stdout,
read as `tool_call_progress`
([item-detail tests](../../tests/codex/codex-item-detail.test.ts)).

**Reasoning:** `thread/start` sends `experimentalRawEvents: true`, which adds
`rawResponseItem/completed` frames; `reasoning` events come only from those
(`item/started|completed` reasoning items carry no event). The generated
protocol schema (`codex app-server generate-json-schema`, [env] 0.154.0)
lists the flag on neither `ThreadStartParams` nor `ThreadResumeParams`, yet on
`thread/start` it yields raw frames: each turn opens with the raw `message`
items codex sent (developer skills/plugin instructions, the user prompt),
then reasoning, `function_call`, `function_call_output` and assistant message
items. On `thread/resume` the flag is inert, so a resumed stream has no
`reasoning` events (its reasoning items have empty summary and content). On
`gpt-5.3-codex-spark` every reasoning step is an `item/started` +
`item/completed { type: "reasoning", summary: [], content: [] }` pair plus
one raw reasoning item with empty `summary` and an `encrypted_content`, read
as `reasoning { kind: "redacted" }`; no plaintext reasoning appeared in any
live run (`reasoningEffort: "medium"`, `reasoningOutputTokens` > 0).
[Reasoning tests](../../tests/codex/codex-reasoning.test.ts),
[projection][oar-projection].

**Native children (nested):** the pinned `collabAgentToolCall` schema carries
`senderThreadId`, `receiverThreadIds`, and `agentsStates`; `subAgentActivity`
identifies a thread/path; the rolling guide documents `collabToolCall` with
different fields instead. Claude's `parent_tool_use_id` is not Codex's
linkage. OAR records notifications of other thread ids as child-session
records (`sessionId` is the child thread, a `graph()` node) and adds a
`tool_call` edge from the sender (`senderThreadId`, else the thread that
reported the item) to each `receiverThreadIds` / `agentThreadId` entry that
is not the sender. Lineage (an edge) stays distinct from observation (a
node), and no edge is fabricated. `agentPath` stays `[]` on every record:
attribution is `nested` (child session ids). Collaboration items carry no events,
except that `item/completed` for a `subAgentActivity` about the reporting
thread's own child is a task event with the child thread as task id (and as
`childSessionId` on `task_started`): `started` → `task_started` (the
`agentPath` as description), `interacted` → `task_updated` running,
`completed` → `task_ended` completed, `interrupted` → `task_ended` stopped
([env] 0.149.0 to 0.158.0, `completed` on 0.158.0; [tasks][oar-tasks],
[task views](../spec/subagents.md#tasks)). A subagent that messages a sibling
or the root reports `subAgentActivity` (`interacted`) on its own thread too
(0.158.0: alpha's `interacted /root/beta`, gamma's `interacted /root`); that
item stays on its frame and changes no task and no edge. Whether the item is
about the reporter's own child is decided by the recorded `started`, else by
the parent of its `agentPath`, else taken to be the reporter's
([#65](https://github.com/botiverse/oar/pull/65)).

On the wire, with `multi_agent` enabled ([env]; the item vocabulary differs
by build):

- Child notifications arrive on the parent's connection; the projection
  derives the child session and exactly one root → child edge (0.149.0: 3/3
  runs of `codex-child-threads.ts`; 0.154.0: live-contract `subagent`). No
  child `thread/started` is sent (the root's carries `parentThreadId: null`);
  the child first appears as `thread/status/changed` (idle → active → idle)
  with its own `threadId`, on 0.154.0 before the spawn item names it, so the
  graph node precedes the edge. The child then emits its own `warning`,
  `mcpServer/startupStatus/updated` ×4, `turn/started`, items,
  `rawResponseItem/completed` (raw events are on for the child),
  `thread/tokenUsage/updated` ×2, `turn/completed`.
- 0.149.0 emitted `subAgentActivity { kind: "started", agentThreadId:
  <child>, agentPath: "/root/<name>" }` (the edge source) plus
  `collabAgentToolCall { tool: "wait", status: "inProgress" → "completed",
  senderThreadId: <root>, receiverThreadIds: [] }`; the child emitted
  `subAgentActivity { kind: "interacted", agentThreadId: <root>, agentPath:
  "/root" }` once, which adds no edge and no task event because it names
  the parent.
- 0.154.0 (Spark, `multi_agent` stable/on, `multi_agent_v2` off) emitted only
  `collabAgentToolCall` (`tool: "spawnAgent"` and `"wait"`; no
  `subAgentActivity`, no `collabToolCall`) with `senderThreadId` (root),
  `receiverThreadIds` (`[]` on the spawn `item/started`, the child id on its
  `item/completed` and on both `wait` frames), `agentsStates` keyed by child
  id (`pendingInit` → `completed` with the child's final message), `prompt`,
  `model`, `reasoningEffort`. The edge derives from the spawn completion; the
  `wait` frames repeat it and `graph()` holds one edge. Spark discovers the
  collaboration tools through a `tool_search_call` (namespace
  `multi_agent_v1`) before the raw `spawn_agent` / `wait_agent`
  `function_call` items.
- `thread/tokenUsage/updated` arrives for both threads, each cumulative for
  its own thread; the child's stays in the child session's records, out of
  the root `usage()` (0.154.0: root 66290 in / 761 out after the turn, the
  child's cumulative 27317 kept apart).
- The child's `turn/completed` can precede the root's or never arrive; the
  root's own `turn/completed { status: "completed" }` came every time, its
  `wait` item completing on the child's message. `awaitTurnEnd` and the
  `model` / `usage` / `contextUsage` folds therefore scope to the root
  session ([fold tests](../../tests/observe-folds.test.ts)).
- No `toApp` request arrived during a sub-agent turn. Control of child
  threads is not exposed.

### Models, instructions, and context

**Model (mapped):** `model` on open selects the model for `thread/start` /
`thread/resume`; `model()` folds the open reply's `model` event (the runtime's
readback, available at open), and a readback differing from an explicit
request fails the open (`codex <method> kept model <readback> although
<requested> was requested`). An unknown model opens: `thread/start` reads the
slug back (`model: "oar-no-such-model-xyz"`) with a `warning` "Model metadata
… not found"; the first `turn/start` is accepted, then
`thread/status/changed { type: "systemError" }`, an `error` notification and
`turn/completed { status: "failed" }` give `turn_ended` failed with reason
`failed: {"type":"error","status":400,"error":{"type":"invalid_request_error","message":"The
'oar-no-such-model-xyz' model is not supported when using Codex with a
ChatGPT account."}}`, class `invalid_request` (live-contract `bad-model`;
[readback probe](../../experiments/session-model-readback.ts)).

**Effort (mapped):** `SessionOptions.effort` governs every turn of the
thread, a turn codex starts from its own queue included ([env] 0.155.1). A
new thread takes it as the config override `config: {model_reasoning_effort}`
on `thread/start`; each Responses request then carries `reasoning: {effort}`,
and the reply's `reasoningEffort`, codex's word, is the open frame's `effort`
event. A resume takes no config override, because any `config` on
`thread/resume` rebuilds the thread's settings from `config.toml` and the
rebuild stays with the thread (live: a `gpt-6-luna` thread resumed without
`model` came back as `gpt-6-astra`, and a later plain resume with no turn
between still answered the config's model;
[experiment](../../experiments/effort-channels.ts); the
[vendor test](../../sea-trial/vendor/effort.vendor.test.ts) pins it with a
thread opened off the aimock default). A resume instead reads the level off
its reply and, when it is not the requested one, sends
`thread/settings/update {threadId, effort}` (experimental API, which OAR
enables); codex answers `{}` and pushes `thread/settings/updated
{threadSettings: {model, effort, ...}}`, read as `model` and `effort` events.
Live 2026-09-29: `thread/resume` reported `gpt-6-luna` / `low`, the pushed
settings `gpt-6-luna` / `medium`, and the rollout's `turn_context` recorded
`low`, then `medium`; on codex-aimock the wire read `low, low` over two turns
and `high` after a resume asking for it, on the thread's own model.

The open is refused when a start reply keeps another level (`codex
thread/start kept effort medium although effort low was requested`), or when
the resume update is refused, unconfirmed within 10 s, or pushes another
level. Without an effort, `thread/start` answers `reasoningEffort: null` (the
model default applies) and yields no `effort` event, and a resume runs and
reports the level and model the thread last ran with (live: `medium`,
although `config.toml` says `model_reasoning_effort = "low"`). codex validates
no level: it echoes an unknown one as `reasoningEffort` and forwards it, so
the open succeeds and the provider refuses the first turn (`turn_ended`
failed, `invalid_request`: "[ReasoningEffortParam] [reasoning.effort]
[invalid_enum_value] Invalid value: 'oar-no-such-effort'. Supported values
are: 'none', 'minimal', 'low', 'medium', 'high', 'xhigh', and 'max'."). The
per-turn `turn/start {effort}` ("for this turn and subsequent turns") is not
used: a submission codex drains from its queue starts a turn without one.
Live changes on a running thread are **not exposed**
([native surfaces](live-configure.md)). [Open request and
read-back][oar-open], [unit test](../../tests/codex/codex-session-effort.test.ts).

**Instructions:** `systemPrompt` maps to `baseInstructions` (replaces codex's
base prompt) and `appendSystemPrompt` to `developerInstructions` (appended as
a developer message); `instructions` / `userInstructions` are silently
ignored by `thread/start`. Cwd and the process environment overlay are
forwarded. Requested and effective configuration remain distinct.
[Vendor test](../../sea-trial/vendor/codex.vendor.test.ts).

**Model listing:** `listModels` runs `codex debug models` (stdout streamed:
the payload is close to 2 MB because every model embeds its instruction
templates), not the app-server's `model/list`; `slug` is identity,
`display_name` presentation only, and `visibility: "hide"` entries are
dropped. Without credentials codex still exits 0 with its built-in fallback
list, so the lister never reports `unauthenticated` and fallback entries can
appear. [Model listing][oar-models],
[list probe](../../experiments/codex-list-models.ts).

**Context (mapped):** native usage separates `total`, `last`, and nullable
`modelContextWindow`. Each `thread/tokenUsage/updated` frame carries a
`usage` event: `context` = `last.totalTokens` (the last model call's input,
cached tokens included, plus its output: what the context holds once the
reply is in) against `modelContextWindow` with a rounded `percent`; `tokens`
= `total` input/output, cumulative for the thread. `last.totalTokens` is
codex's own occupancy reading (`TokenUsage::tokens_in_context_window` returns
`total_tokens`, and the TUI status card reads it off `last_token_usage`;
`protocol/src/protocol.rs` at [`4f39251a`][native-source]); codex's displayed
percent also subtracts a 12k `BASELINE_TOKENS`, which OAR does not. Without
`last` (older builds) occupancy is unknown: the cumulative input stands in as
`tokens` with window and percent null, so the cumulative total is never read
against the window; when only the window is absent, `tokens` is `last`'s and
window and percent are null. `contextUsage()` and `usage()` fold these
events, scoped to the root session.

The figures diverge live: over three one-word turns `total.inputTokens` grew
12661 → 28404 → 44166 while `last.totalTokens` stayed 12684 → 15749 → 15768
(`last.inputTokens` 12661 → 15743 → 15762) against a 121600 window;
`contextUsage()` reads about 11 % (13597 / 121600 after a basic turn) while
`usage()` climbs per turn (live-contract `multi-turn`, `basic`;
[replay test](../../tests/replay/codex-projection.test.ts)). One notification
arrives per model call, so a tool turn reports twice.
`account/rateLimits/updated` follows each model call and has no event ([env]
0.154.0: `limitId: "codex"`, `planType: "pro"`, primary 300-min and secondary
10080-min windows, reflecting the thread model's own windows: a Spark thread
reported 0-4 % / 0-2 % while the account's main Codex weekly window stood at
88 %). [Thread schema][thread-schema], [usage projection][oar-projection].

**Compaction:** a `contextCompaction` item yields `compaction_started` on
`item/started` and `compaction_ended` (completed, no trigger) on
`item/completed`; the deprecated `thread/compacted` notification (schema:
"Deprecated: Use ContextCompaction item type instead") ends an open compaction
only when the item did not already, which the projection's `compacting` flag
tracks [env 0.154.0 schema; not yet reached live]. Native manual compaction
(`thread/compact/start`, a client request) has no typed OAR operation; the
vendor instruction test defers compaction survival until it does.

### Tools, permissions, and client callbacks

App-server supports native policy plus server requests for command/file/permission
decisions, user input, MCP elicitation, and experimental dynamic tools. OAR
records each server request as a `toApp` request record and never answers it:
it sets `approvalPolicy: never` and launches with `-c
sandbox_mode="danger-full-access"`, the only seam that governs codex's exec
tool (`thread/start.sandboxMode` does not; pinned on a real login).
`OAR_CODEX_SANDBOX` pins a stricter mode, and `OAR_CODEX_SANDBOX=inherit`
skips the override so the user's own configuration wins. Configurations
requiring interactive settlement have no supported OAR interaction path: the
dangling request is the honest record
([stream tests](../../tests/codex/codex-session-stream.test.ts)); none arrived
in any live run.

OAR projects command execution, file changes, MCP calls, web search and
sleeps ([outcomes](#tool-call-outcome-reporting)), but exposes no tool registration,
dynamic-tool execution callback, MCP management, or elicitation API.
Runtime-owned tools (MCP servers, skills, plugins) come from native
configuration. The inventories read them on their own app-server process:
`skills/list` and paginated `mcpServerStatus/list`, with tools explicitly
MCP-only (2026-09-16; [query contract](../spec/inventory.md),
[native probe evidence](inventory.md)). [Native interaction flows][approvals],
[transport][oar-transport], [projection][oar-projection].

### Process ownership, installation, and account usage

**Mapped:** OAR owns the spawned app-server; disposal kills it and waits for
the exit because the process may hold state (codex's sqlite runtime in
`CODEX_HOME`) that the next session needs released. On POSIX the app-server
leads its own process group, so the kill (SIGTERM, then SIGKILL after a grace
period: 10 s, or `OAR_KILL_GRACE_MS`) also reaches the commands and MCP
servers it started, and disposal settles even when it ignores SIGTERM
([test](../../tests/session-dispose.test.ts)). This supplies resource
release, not detached execution or a lease against other controllers of the
persisted thread. The environment overlay applies to the child process.

**First open per `CODEX_HOME` (coordinated):** native 0.160.0 can fail SQLite
initialization when several processes first open a fresh shared home: a direct
Linux probe failed 21/24 starts, while independent homes, a completed prior
initialization, and serial starts each initialized 24/24; this does not
establish the cause of similar Windows CI failures
([reproduction and limits](../../experiments/codex-concurrent-startup.md),
[upstream issue](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/50290)). OAR
therefore coordinates the first app-server initialization of each home
within one loaded adapter module. Sessions, account usage and inventories
share this entry point: one process starts, and the others wait until its
`initialize` succeeds and `initialized` is sent; later starts on that home
can run concurrently. A failed initializer releases the next waiting client
after its exit, and its own caller still receives the original failure. Cancelling
a waiting client keeps its process from spawning, and query deadlines include
the wait. There is no added warmup process, delay or retry. The home is keyed
from the child's effective environment and working directory, with relative
paths and symlinks resolved and trailing separators ignored; readiness comes
from the observed handshake, not from a database file, and replacing the home
directory invalidates it. The coordination does not cover other host
processes, separately loaded copies of OAR, or `codex debug models`, and it
is neither a native migration lock nor arbitration between controllers of
one thread
([implementation](../../packages/oar/src/runtimes/codex/home-initialization.ts),
[cancellation and concurrency tests](../../tests/codex/codex-home-initialization.test.ts)).

`codex debug models` stays outside because it did not initialize the SQLite
state database on 0.160.0/Linux (the probe's custom provider, no login): 24
standalone readers and 21 readers alongside three app-servers succeeded,
models-only homes held just their input config, and file-system tracing saw
no SQLite paths; the native implementation uses a separate model
catalog/cache. This is evidence for that version and environment, not a
guarantee
([models control and source](../../experiments/codex-concurrent-startup.md#model-listing-alongside-startup)).
A [vendor regression](../../sea-trial/vendor/codex.vendor.test.ts) bypasses
test-home warmup and opens eight real sessions concurrently in a fresh home:
all eight opened on 0.160.0/Linux (2026-10-02), and the test runs in the
cross-platform Codex CI jobs. It does not establish the root cause of the
earlier Windows failures.

**Exit diagnostics:** the process layer drains stderr continuously and keeps
its last 8 KiB. When the app-server exits, pending and later RPC calls fail
with its exit code, signal, any native spawn error and the stderr tail seen
by then, in the exception's message and cause; the `exited` record keeps its
shape. `OAR_CHILD_STDERR=inherit` also forwards stderr to the host's. A host
can tell a missing executable from a native crash; OAR makes no automatic
retry decision
([exit diagnostics tests](../../tests/codex/codex-exit-diagnostics.test.ts),
[spawn failure test](../../tests/codex/codex-startup-diagnostics.test.ts)).

Installation checks `OAR_CODEX_BIN`, then `codex` on PATH, then the macOS
desktop bundles (`ChatGPT.app` before the legacy `Codex.app`, system before
per-user installs), and requires `codex app-server --help` to succeed; a
codex without the app-server surface is unsupported. Account usage is a
separate reader on its own app-server process (`initialize`, `account/read`,
`account/rateLimits/read`, with `reauth_required` / `unsupported` outcomes and
rate-limit buckets merged as the codex TUI does); neither it nor installation
discovery is inferred from turn token totals. Update checks read the
`updates.status` row of `codex doctor --json`, and upgrades run `codex update`
with a version read-back ([runtime updaters](update.md)). Login management is
**not exposed**. An installation probe that cannot run keeps its native error
code, signal, timeout, exit code and bounded stderr tail in the thrown error;
the probe deadline is unchanged, and an ordinary nonzero readiness exit still
classifies the installation as unsupported.

## Harness fact matrix

Answers to the harness investigation questions for the one interface OAR
calls: app-server protocol v2 over stdio, one process per Session. Evidence
labels: **source** is OAR code (the current mapping is in the sections
above); **source upstream** is the codex-rs tree at
[`2151d3a5`][upstream-tree]; **observed** is a recorded run on a named binary
(codex 0.154.0 live contract; 0.149.0 child thread probe); **observed by
@Faye** is her app-server probe of 2026-09-12, death boundary included
([investigation PR][faye-probe]), over the websocket transport against a local
Responses API mock with an isolated `CODEX_HOME`, so it speaks to server
behaviour, not to OAR's stdio path; **vendor** is native documentation no
observation here has confirmed.

**Resume** is the runtime rebuilding model context from its own persisted
material. **Replay** is OAR rebuilding an observer's event sequence from its
own appended stream, independent of runtime resume. The "runtime side resume
material" row describes the former only.

### Matrix columns

| Column | Codex on OAR's path | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Session identity | The native thread id ([mapping](#high-level-mapping-to-oar)). It survives the OAR process once codex has written the thread's rollout under `CODEX_HOME`. In the probe, a thread with no turn lived only in the server's in-memory loaded set: `thread/loaded/list` shows it, `thread/list` does not, the rollout `path` in the start reply does not exist on disk, and `thread/resume` fails `-32600 no rollout found` (observed by @Faye; matches the live contract observation on 0.154.0). | source [adapter][oar-session]; observed live contract resume 0.154.0; observed by @Faye; source upstream [rollout crate][upstream-rollout] |
| Connection identity | Implicit (of none, implicit, explicit id): the subscription relation is the identity. No frame carries a connection id, request ids are per client integers from 1, and over websocket neither the upgrade response nor the `initialize` reply carries one (observed by @Faye). The server keeps a `ConnectionId` per transport connection (`thread_state.rs`: `live_connections` and a per thread subscriber set that `thread/start` and `thread/resume` join and `thread/unsubscribe` leaves; a closed connection drops its pending request contexts) and a persistent `connection_id` column in `logs_2.sqlite` (0.153.4); neither reaches the wire. A client death leaves the subscriber set without any frame to the others. | source [transport][oar-transport]; source upstream [thread state][upstream-thread-state], [outgoing messages][upstream-outgoing]; observed by @Faye |
| Transport cursor | **Live stream cursor** (a position a reconnecting client hands back to get missed frames): none. No notification carries a sequence field, `turnId` is a span label and a `thread/items/list` filter, and `thread/resume` on a running thread delivers history plus a fresh full copy of every later frame, not a continuation (upstream comment "sends the thread's history to the client and atomically subscribes for new updates"; observed by @Faye: after B resumes, A and B receive frame for frame identical method sequences). **History pagination cursor:** `thread/resume` returns `itemsBackwardsCursor` and `turnsBackwardsCursor`, documented as opaque but observed as plaintext JSON `{ requestedThreadId, rolloutOrdinal, includeAnchor, scope }`; `rolloutOrdinal` is the `ordinal` every rollout line carries, monotonic from 0; a hand built cursor is accepted by `thread/items/list` and pages in both `sortDirection` values. It cannot reach a delta, because deltas are not persisted (question 2). OAR's process local `seq` is the only live cursor on this path. | source [kernel][oar-kernel]; source upstream [thread schema][upstream-thread-rs]; observed by @Faye |
| Event stream scope | One event record per notification on this stdio connection, child threads included, which arrive on the parent's connection (observed 0.149.0 and 0.154.0). As the sole subscriber OAR receives both [tiers](#broadcast-tier-and-subscription-tier) merged. | source [projection][oar-projection]; observed [child thread probe](../../experiments/codex-child-threads.ts); source upstream [outgoing messages][upstream-outgoing]; observed by @Faye |
| Runtime side resume material | `rollout-<timestamp>-<threadId>.jsonl` under `CODEX_HOME/sessions`, indexed by a sqlite state database in the same home: what `should_persist_response_item` and `should_persist_event_msg` admit (messages, reasoning, tool calls with outputs, compaction markers, turn started, completed, aborted, token counts), nothing OAR appended ([question 2](#six-questions)). `thread/resume` with `excludeTurns: true` feeds it to the model and replays nothing to OAR. Diagnostic reference only: OAR never replays observers from it. | source upstream [persistence policy][upstream-policy]; source adapter; observed [resume](#connection-session-creation-and-resume) |
| Vendor claim versus evidence | Observed on 0.154.0: resume continuity with `excludeTurns`, steer, queue, interrupt, dispose mid turn, child notifications on the parent connection, `exited` after kill; on 0.158.0, one run: a queued submission surviving process tree death. Probed outside OAR: websocket and unix socket transports. Vendor only: `codex app-server proxy`, the app-server daemon, Codex Cloud `history` resume, `ephemeral` threads, ingress overload error `-32001`. Unverified either way: arbitration between competing controllers, resumed reasoning content, compaction frames, what happens when a recorded server request is never answered. | this page, [open gaps](#verification-and-open-gaps), [crash and resume](crash-resume.md); vendor [app-server README][upstream-readme] |

### Eight dimensions

1. **Entry.** See [connection](#connection-session-creation-and-resume).
   Present upstream but not on OAR's path: `--listen ws://`,
   `--listen unix://`, `codex app-server daemon`, `codex app-server proxy`,
   `thread/fork`, `ephemeral`, `thread/resume { path }` and `{ history }`
   (vendor README).
2. **Session and state storage.** Thread identity, rollout, and the sqlite
   index are codex's, under `CODEX_HOME`. OAR owns no storage: its record
   stream is process memory behind `records()`, gone with the process
   ([kernel][oar-kernel]; source upstream rollout crate).
3. **Event model.** One record per JSON-RPC notification (`type` = method,
   `native` = params verbatim, the turn id as `spanId`); server requests (frames with
   both `id` and `method`) become `toApp` requests nobody answers; pre-open
   frames precede the open event; `turn/completed`'s `turn.status`
   (`completed`, `interrupted`, `failed`, `inProgress`) settles the outcome
   ([mapping](#high-level-mapping-to-oar);
   [stream tests](../../tests/codex/codex-session-stream.test.ts)).
4. **Ownership and identity.** The spawning OAR process owns the child;
   records carry `sessionId` and `agentPath`, and other threads become child
   records linked by collab `tool_call` edges. There is no lease: two OAR
   Sessions resuming one thread id are not arbitrated by codex (observed).
   The rollout's first line, `session_meta`, records an `originator` equal to
   the creating client's `clientInfo.name`, so a thread OAR created is marked
   `oar`; it is self reported and not verifiable (observed by @Faye).
5. **Capability honesty.** Declared as in the [mapping](#high-level-mapping-to-oar).
   Steer (`turn/steer { expectedTurnId }`) and queue (`thread/queue/add
   { clientUserMessageId }`) are held by codex, which is why queue is
   declared durable and the session has no `withdraw`; survival of process
   tree death was observed once ([queue](#prompt-steering-queueing-and-abort)).
6. **Deployment and lifecycle.** Local subprocess only. Process exit is an
   `exited` response answering `dispose`, or with `requestId ""` when codex
   died on its own (a live SIGKILL reads `code: null`; the fake-process test
   pins `137`). Pending requests are rejected `app-server exited`, later
   controls `runtime exited`, and `awaitTurnEnd` fails `runtime_exited`. No
   runtime frame announces death. Hosted forms upstream (daemon with
   `enable-remote-control`, unix socket control plane, proxy) are vendor only
   here ([pre-open tests](../../tests/codex/codex-pre-open.test.ts); vendor
   [daemon README][upstream-daemon]).
7. **Tools and permissions.** `approvalPolicy: "never"` and a full access
   sandbox, so no approval request is expected; one that arrives is recorded
   and left dangling ([tools](#tools-permissions-and-client-callbacks),
   [outcomes](#tool-call-outcome-reporting)).
8. **Extension points.** MCP servers, skills, apps, collab agents, and
   dynamic tools exist natively; OAR passes none of them. A Session's
   control calls are `turn/start`, `turn/steer`, `thread/queue/add` and
   `turn/interrupt`; inventories and account usage run their own app-server
   processes, and model listing runs `codex debug models`.

### Six questions

1. **Is the native session id stable across a host restart, and can it be
   reopened?** Yes ([resume](#connection-session-creation-and-resume)): a
   new process keeps the id and the model recalls earlier turns (observed,
   live contract; in another `cwd` too, 0.160.0), given the rollout under
   the active `CODEX_HOME`; a
   completed turn is not required once the rollout is written, but a newly
   allocated id without one is not enough ([floors](#resumability-floors)).
   An already subscribed connection silently drops the model override
   (observed). Upstream also accepts a rollout `path` and a Codex Cloud
   `history` (vendor).
2. **Does the runtime log keep every frame or only turn snapshots?**
   Neither: the rollout is a filtered item log. The persistence policy
   admits selected response items and core events, one line each with an
   explicit `ordinal`; app-server notifications as sent (`item/started`,
   deltas, `thread/tokenUsage/updated`), server requests, and OAR's own
   requests and rejections are absent by construction. A turn that emitted
   five `item/agentMessage/delta` frames left a 49 line rollout whose line
   types were only `session_meta`, `turn_context`, `world_state`,
   `response_item`, `event_msg` (`task_started`, `item_completed`,
   `token_count`, `task_complete`), and `token_usage_record` (observed by
   @Faye). Source upstream [policy][upstream-policy].
3. **Is a stream rebuilt from that log isomorphic to the original?** No.
   Absent: every OAR request and response record, `seq`, the pre-open
   frames, every delta, every server request. Recoverable: message content,
   tool calls with outputs and status, turn boundaries with status, token
   counts. A rebuild is a subset with a different envelope.
4. **Can a second observer attach to the same session?** On OAR's stream,
   any number: `rawEvents` with a cursor replays retained records after
   `afterSeq`, then continues live ([kernel][oar-kernel]); one stdio process
   has no second reader. On a shared server a connection that calls
   `thread/resume` gets its own full copy of every content frame from then
   on, and one that never subscribes gets only the broadcast tier (observed
   by @Faye). Neither receives earlier frames except through the history
   pages.
5. **Is there a recognizable last frame on process death, and what does the
   log say about an in flight tool call?** On OAR's path the process is the
   server: no runtime frame marks its death, the last record is OAR's
   `exited` response with `requestId ""`, a `tool_call_started` stays
   without `tool_call_ended`, and a child `turn/completed` may never arrive
   ([dispose](#prompt-steering-queueing-and-abort)); the rollout keeps the
   call without output, and after a resume the model is shown `aborted` for
   it, filled in when codex rebuilds the history and never written
   ([persistence surfaces](#four-persistence-surfaces-and-what-each-is-worth-at-death);
   0.158.0 in [crash and resume](crash-resume.md)). On a shared server a
   client death is not a thread event: a surviving subscriber receives every
   remaining frame through `turn/completed` with nothing marking the loss,
   and a turn whose only client was killed still runs to `completed`, with
   all items persisted, for a client that connects ten seconds later
   (observed by @Faye).
6. **Do hosted forms report environment lifecycle events?** Not on OAR's
   path. Upstream, a daemon or unix socket server outlives any one client
   and unloads idle unsubscribed threads; `thread/status/changed` is
   broadcast, so thread activity is visible to observers, but a peer
   connection closing produces no frame (observed by @Faye). Whether a
   client is told about an unload is unverified; the daemon and proxy paths
   are open.

### Tool call outcome reporting

Codex reports status on tool items (source upstream [item schema][upstream-item]):
`commandExecution` carries `status` (`completed`, `failed`, `declined`,
`inProgress`) and `exitCode`; `fileChange` carries `status` (same set);
`mcpToolCall`, `dynamicToolCall`, and `collabAgentToolCall` carry `status`
(`completed`, `failed`, `inProgress`), and `mcpToolCall` adds `error
{ message }`; `webSearch` and `sleep` have no status. OAR maps explicit
`completed` to `tool_call_ended.result: "ok"` and explicit `failed` to
`"failed"`; any other status, `declined` included, or none leaves `result`
absent, the native status remaining on the frame (a `sleep` ends with neither
`result` nor `content`,
[item-detail tests](../../tests/codex/codex-item-detail.test.ts)). OAR does
not infer a result from an exit code or output. A `commandExecution` item's `exitCode` is carried as
`tool_call_ended.exitCode` (`null` when codex reports a signal exit, absent
when the item has none), and its `aggregatedOutput` is the event's text
`content` as-is (the status when the output is empty), the exit status not
folded in. An `mcpToolCall`'s MCP blocks are its ordered parts (an image is an
image part); other items' `content` comes from [`item-detail.ts`][oar-item-detail].

## Native storage and listing, probed live

Evidence baseline for this section: **codex-cli 0.153.4**, Linux x86_64,
probed 2026-09-12 through the app-server control socket (a WebSocket over
AF_UNIX) against an isolated `CODEX_HOME`, so the shared `~/.codex` socket was
never created or touched. Statements are observations unless labelled a vendor
declaration or an inference; [env] marks a claim that holds only on this
binary. Nothing here is OAR behaviour: it is what the runtime does underneath
the adapter, including two capability-honesty failures a client cannot detect
from the response it gets.

### `thread/list` can return a well-formed empty page over a populated database

With 8 `threads` rows and 7 rollout files whose threads resume and load,
`thread/list` returned `{"data": [], "nextCursor": null, "backwardsCursor":
null}` on every call. When the client omits `modelProviders`, the server adds
a `threads.model_provider IN (...)` clause that no row can satisfy. Varying only
that parameter, database and daemon untouched:

| `modelProviders` sent | Rows returned |
|---|---|
| omitted | 0 |
| `null` | 0 |
| `[]` | 7, every row with `preview <> ''` |
| `["mockr"]` | 4 |
| all four providers | 7 |

`Some(vec![])` omits the clause and `None` adds it, so **the absent parameter
is strictly more restrictive than the explicit empty one**: a client that
means "do not filter" has to send `[]`. [env] The default query evaluates four
columns only (all 38 swept): `archived`, `preview`, `source` and
`model_provider`; rows pass `source`, so it is not the excluder. What the
`None` branch binds is **not established**. The best reading is SQL `NULL`
(`x IN (NULL)` is NULL for every row, so not empty, never satisfied, never
an error, matching all three observations), but **that is an inference, not
an observation**, and value probing cannot settle it: inside a pure
conjunction NULL and false are observationally identical. Excluded by probing: 13
non-`threads` tables renamed one at a time (only `thread_sections` fired, a
different join) and 66 candidate values spanning all five SQLite storage
classes.

### Empty pages have at least four causes

Rows with an empty `preview` are invisible by design: `threads` carries three
partial indexes, `idx_threads_visible_created_at_ms`, `_updated_at_ms` and
`_recency_at_ms`, all `WHERE preview <> ''` ("visible" is the runtime's own
word). Such a row never appears even with `modelProviders: []`, yet it
resumes: listability and resumability are independent. The list path also
swallows database errors: with the whole `threads` table renamed away, the
wire still carries a well-formed `{"data": [], "nextCursor": null}`, and the
only trace is one daemon log line, `WARN codex_rollout::state_db: state db
list_threads failed: ...` (the list path is `codex_rollout::state_db`;
`codex_state` has zero hits in trace-level logs). **On the wire, "the
database is broken" and "there are no threads" are indistinguishable.** The
causes must not be collapsed into one:

| Real cause of an empty page | Character |
|---|---|
| the database genuinely holds no thread | normal |
| rows exist but `preview` is empty, so they are filtered by design | legitimate, listability is its own state face |
| `modelProviders` omitted, injecting an unsatisfiable condition | defect |
| a database error was swallowed | defect |

### Probe method and its limits

The method works against any closed-source SQLite reader. sqlx statements
never reach the daemon log, even at trace level (`sqlx`, `codex_state` and
`threads.rs` have zero hits while `tokio_tungstenite`, `mio::poll` and
`notify::inotify` appear: the EnvFilter is global, and sqlx either logs
through `log` without a `tracing-log` bridge or has statement logging off at
`ConnectOptions`, neither reachable from outside the process). So the probe
breaks the schema and lets the failure name the identifier: `ALTER TABLE
threads RENAME TO threads_real`, then a same-named view of all 38 columns
with exactly one replaced by an expression that fails at runtime. SQLite evaluates it only
for rows that reach it, so a WARN proves the column was evaluated. Working
poisons: `abs(-9223372036854775808)` (integer overflow),
`zeroblob(2000000000)` and `randomblob(2000000000)` (string or blob too big),
`load_extension('nope')`; `9223372036854775807+1` returns a real and does not
error. `CASE id WHEN '<id1>' THEN <cand1> ... END AS model_provider` tests N
candidates in one query, the returned id naming the match, and renaming each
table in turn shows which tables a closed query touches. Limits:

1. **A poison firing and a row count cannot be read from the same run:** a
   firing poison forces the count to 0 (one combined run read the
   self-contradictory `passWHERE=YES n=4`).
2. **An empty literal `IN ()` does not evaluate its left-hand side; an empty
   subquery `IN (SELECT 1 WHERE 0)` does.** A firing poison proves the clause
   exists, **not** that the bound list is non-empty.
3. **An absent syscall does not prove a path was not taken.** `thread/list`
   reads the state database (0 `pread64` in the control run, 6 in the
   treatment run), yet SQLite's in-process page cache served a small, fully
   cached database with no syscall at all.

### Four persistence surfaces, and what each is worth at death

Log completeness can only be answered per surface.

| Surface | Behaviour at death | Usable as truth |
|---|---|---|
| rollout JSONL | no completed append was lost in the observed SIGKILL runs; power-loss durability was not tested | yes, the sole truth |
| `thread_history_1.sqlite` projection | keeps pace even under SIGKILL, rebuilt incrementally from a byte offset plus `next_rollout_ordinal` | yes, but it is a projection |
| `logs_2.sqlite` | a buffered, periodically flushed sink that does not flush at death; a short-lived process can lose all of it | no |
| `session_index.jsonl` | appends thread name changes only, 3 rows locally, all for zero-turn threads | no, it is not a session table |

- **A tool-call result may be `unknown` or `in-flight` and must not be coerced
  to `failed`.** A SIGKILL leaves a `function_call` with neither an output nor
  a failure; writing it down as failed manufactures a fact. A graceful drain
  is the opposite case: the rollout already holds `failed` and `-1` while the
  wire has carried nothing.
- **Append-before-deliver needs ordering and granularity together.** Appending
  before delivering makes replay-from-log a superset of what any connection
  received, so a reconnect only fetches the difference (delivering first loses
  "delivered but not persisted" at the death point, and no contract can repair
  that), and **the append granularity must not be coarser than the delivery
  granularity**. Codex satisfies both at event granularity and fails the
  second at delta granularity: deltas are delivered and never persisted.

The ordinal has three spellings that should not be mixed: the rollout JSONL
line key `ordinal`, the wire cursor payload field `rolloutOrdinal`, and the
SQLite projection column `next_rollout_ordinal`.

### Resumability floors

An id is minted, persisted, and becomes resumable at three different moments;
a caller needs the floor.

- Thread floor: the rollout's first append, ordinal 0 `session_meta`. A thread
  interrupted by SIGKILL still resumes.
- Item floor, strictly higher: `item_completed` reaching disk. A thread killed
  mid-item resumes reporting `itemsBackwardsCursor.rolloutOrdinal` 7 where a
  cleanly ended twin reports 17.
- Resume returns a cursor, not content: `initialTurnsPage` is `null`.
- An empty `thread/list` page is not evidence that nothing is resumable
  (the `modelProviders` defect, independent listability). Turn-less threads
  do not enter `thread/list` at all.

### Broadcast tier and subscription tier

Notifications split into two tiers, identically over stdio and over the
WebSocket on AF_UNIX (the `proxy --sock` path is a byte relay and does not
itself upgrade), matching the upstream `Broadcast` versus `ToConnection`
envelopes ([outgoing messages][upstream-outgoing]) and @Faye's websocket probe.

- Broadcast tier, reaching every initialized connection, including one that
  never named the thread: `thread/started`, `thread/name/updated`,
  `thread/status/changed`.
- Subscription tier, reaching only connections subscribed through
  `thread/start` or `thread/resume`, each with a full copy: `turn/*`,
  `item/*`, the deltas, and `thread/tokenUsage/updated`.

`thread/unsubscribe` closes the subscription tier only, so an observer
connection sees whether a thread is busy but not what it is doing; the server
unloads a thread that is idle with no subscribers. With implicit connection
identity and no live-stream cursor ([matrix](#matrix-columns)), the exact live
notification sequence, deltas especially, cannot be recovered from the
runtime; persisted items remain available through history APIs.

### Acknowledgement, persisted preference, and runtime state can disagree

Each capability has to be asked which face carries its real state; the three
faces routinely answer differently. Enabling remote control, the CLI reports
`enabled`, nothing is persisted (`persistence_preference: None`), and the
runtime reports `Connecting -> Errored`: one log line carries
`desired_state=Enabled { persistence_preference: None }` immediately followed
by `Connecting -> Errored`, all three faces at the same instant, disagreeing.
**Reading only the CLI's `enabled` yields an entirely wrong conclusion.**

## Verification and open gaps

[`experiments/live-contract.ts codex`](../../experiments/live-contract.ts)
covers every promise above on a real login, one voyage log per scenario:
basic, multi-turn, tool-detail, busy-and-late-control, steer, queue, abort,
dispose-mid-turn, cursor, resume, subagent, kill-runtime, bad-model. The
[experiments index](../../experiments/README.md) lists the further probes
(handshake; adapter steer/abort/busy; resume; resume with a model switch;
queue; model listing; model readback; child threads). Unit and replay tests
pin: the notification → record projection, child-thread attribution, collab
edges, the error-detail fold, the context/usage split and compaction
([replay](../../tests/replay/codex-projection.test.ts)); that a child
session's turn end and usage never satisfy the root folds
([folds](../../tests/observe-folds.test.ts)); resume parameters and model
mismatch ([resume](../../tests/codex/codex-session-resume-model.test.ts));
the stream shape: request/response ordering, busy, steer, queue and abort
replies, a refused interrupt, an unanswered server request, an unrequested
exit ([stream](../../tests/codex/codex-session-stream.test.ts)); pre-open
ordering, the open event ahead of a same-chunk `thread/started`, and control
after an unrequested death ([pre-open](../../tests/codex/codex-pre-open.test.ts));
item detail (the `sleep` item included), reasoning classification, the
effort read-back, first-open coordination per home and exit diagnostics
([codex tests](../../tests/codex/)). [Vendor
tests](../../sea-trial/vendor/codex.vendor.test.ts) use the real app-server
with a scripted provider for tools, errors, instructions, usage shape and
verbatim stream order. [CI](../../.github/workflows/ci.yml) runs that backend
on three operating systems with an unpinned CLI; configuration does not prove
a release passed.

Open gaps:

- Compaction: the per-call context reading is verified; compaction frames,
  context after native compaction, and instruction survival through it are
  not, and `thread/compact/start` is unreachable through the Session API.
- Resumed reasoning: raw events cannot be enabled on `thread/resume`, so a
  resumed session has no `reasoning` events.
- Queue durability across process death: one whole-tree SIGKILL run on
  0.158.0 ([crash and resume](crash-resume.md)), not repeated.
- Server requests are recorded, never answered; no configuration requiring
  approval, user input or elicitation has been exercised.
- Child threads: delivery and identity are [env] on 0.149.0 / 0.154.0 with
  differing item vocabularies; control of child threads is not exposed; a
  child `turn/completed` that never arrives is observed but unexplained.
- Missing/unloadable thread ids on resume are pinned only by the fake-process
  path; concurrent controllers of one thread are not arbitrated.
- Storage (0.153.4): the `modelProviders` `None` branch's bound value is an
  inference (SQL `NULL`) that probing from outside cannot settle; why
  `thread_sections` joins the default `thread/list` query is unexplained;
  `thread/environment/connected` and `thread/environment/disconnected` exist
  in the protocol but were not observed live (vendor declaration only);
  `threads.sandbox_policy` reads `{"type":"disabled"}` while the same
  thread's `turn_context.sandbox_policy` reads
  `{"type":"danger-full-access"}`, recorded, not reconciled.
- Not probed on 0.153.4: `ephemeral: true` on `thread/start`, whether
  unloading a thread notifies clients, `thread/fork`,
  `serverRequest/resolved`, `thread/closed`, `thread/timeline/list`,
  `thread/read`, the write path for `thread_artifacts` /
  `thread_spawn_edges` / `thread_goals`, `codex agents`,
  `codex remote-control pair`, and `write_stdin` against a live unified-exec
  session id.
