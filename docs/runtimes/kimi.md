# Kimi

Independent inventories (2026-09-16): all three independent queries return unsupported on the selected interface. The separately probed Web API is not used.
See the [query contract](../spec/inventory.md) and [native probe evidence](inventory.md).

Evidence baseline: native source
[`kimi-code` `f9ca33376`](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/kimi-code/tree/f9ca33376)
(0.41.0, reviewed 2026-09-08). The
[wire snapshot](../../tests/replay/fixtures/kimi-acp-v1.vendor.json) is
**0.38.0** (2026-08-26; `acp-runtime.ts kimi` ran on it 2026-08-27). Live
observations come from **kimi 0.42.0** (`agentInfo.name` "Kimi Code CLI",
darwin arm64, default model `kimi-code/k3`, no `--model`), 2026-09-11, through
[`experiments/live-contract.ts kimi`](../../experiments/live-contract.ts)
(scenario names in parentheses below) and the kimi probes in the
[experiments index](../../experiments/README.md): `kimi-wire-tap.ts`,
`kimi-usage-update-order.ts live`, `kimi-steer-or-queue.ts`. On **kimi
2.0.0** (2026-09-18) all of them pass unchanged (live-contract 13/13) except
that the `thinking` config option's values are `["low", "high", "max"]`, with
no `"off"`. Facts from later binaries name their version. Versions are
evidence baselines, not a support range. The [spec](../spec/README.md) is the
contract the adapter implements, not evidence of this adapter's behavior; see
the [runtime index](README.md) for status conventions.

## Native concepts and calling interfaces

This page concerns the TypeScript **MoonshotAI/kimi-code** harness. The
separate [Python kimi-cli](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/kimi-cli) is not
interchangeable evidence despite overlapping command and product names.

A native session is a persistent workspace/conversation container. Inside it,
agents have their own context, turns, tool calls, and event scopes. Session
identity, agent identity, numeric turn IDs, and prompt IDs have distinct
roles. Children are native agents with their own lifecycle, including
background execution.

Kimi offers a terminal application and several programmatic surfaces: the
Node SDK (`KimiHarness`/`Session`), native KAP/klient services, and `kimi acp`
for ACP JSON-RPC over stdio. These interfaces expose different subsets.
The [Node Session](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/kimi-code/blob/f9ca33376/packages/node-sdk/src/session.ts#L140-L200)
has prompt/steer methods and approval/question handlers. Native
[agent services](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/kimi-code/blob/f9ca33376/packages/klient/src/contract/agent/services.ts#L28-L55)
separate submission from cancellation. ACP instead binds
[`klient.session(sessionId).agent('main')`](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/kimi-code/blob/f9ca33376/packages/acp-server/src/session.ts#L249-L344)
and translates that agent's event stream, so one ACP session does not expose
every agent in the native session. OAR uses `kimi acp`.

## High-level mapping to OAR

OAR exposes one ordered record stream per Session
([contract](../../packages/oar/src/contracts/session.ts)). Every ACP frame is
recorded verbatim as a frame's `native`; the cross-runtime `events` are what
OAR read out of it. Control calls are request/response record pairs. The
profile declares `capabilities` `{ queue: { durable: false }, attribution:
"opaque" }`, with `images` read from `initialize`; the session has no
`steer`.

| Native concept or owner | Current OAR mapping |
| --- | --- |
| `kimi-code` executable | One `kimi acp` subprocess per OAR Session, spawned in the session `cwd` with the env overlay; its exit is an `exited` response record (answering `dispose` when OAR caused it, `requestId ""` when the process died on its own). |
| Persistent native session | `Session.id` is the native `sessionId`; `SessionOptions.resume` attaches through ACP `session/resume` with a fresh stream (seq 0, no history rebuild), only in the session's own directory. |
| Handshake answers and opening pushes | `initialize`, `authenticate`, `session/new`/`resume`/`load`, `session/set_model`, `session/set_config_option` answers are frame records with `model` and `effort` events where they report one (the `thinking` option's current value is the effort); pushes arriving while opening (`available_commands_update`, `current_mode_update`, `config_option_update`) are recorded in arrival order, so `Session.model()` and `effort()` are folds over the stream. |
| Native agent and turn | Only ACP's `main` agent reaches this transport; every `session/update` is one frame with `native` verbatim. No `spanId` (ACP updates carry no turn id). |
| Prompt, steer, queue, and cancel | `prompt()` is a `toRuntime` request whose `session/prompt` answer carries `turn_ended`. The session has no `steer` (no ACP method); `queue()` is a host-memory FIFO; `abort()` is `session/cancel` with a kill fallback. |
| Typed events, history, and child graph | Events for message/thought/tool/usage/model updates; unknown kinds recorded with no events. No child session arrives on this transport, so the graph holds the root only. |
| Client execution and interaction duties | Every reverse request (`session/request_permission`, `terminal/*`) is a `toApp` request record (verbatim, under the runtime's JSON-RPC id) and OAR's fixed-policy answer the `answered` response; `events()` reads the pair as `app_request` (method as `type`) and `app_answered`. |

See the [Kimi profile](../../packages/oar/src/runtimes/kimi/session.ts),
[ACP opening path](../../packages/oar/src/shared/acp/profile.ts),
[session controller](../../packages/oar/src/shared/acp/session.ts),
[record placement](../../packages/oar/src/shared/acp/records.ts),
[turn machinery](../../packages/oar/src/shared/acp/turns.ts),
[event projection](../../packages/oar/src/shared/acp/projection.ts), and

the [native ACP reference](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/kimi-code/blob/f9ca33376/docs/en/reference/kimi-acp.md).

ACP `tool_call_update` reports `status: "completed" | "failed"` ([src]
ACP schema `ToolCallStatus`); OAR maps those to `tool_call_ended.result:
"ok" | "failed"`, and a non-terminal or missing status leaves the field
absent. "Transport-limited" below means the selected native boundary already
loses the capability.

## Capability details

### Session creation and resume

Native ACP requires `initialize` with the protocol version and client
capabilities. `authenticate { methodId: "login" }` validates readiness rather
than starting login: the
[auth gate](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/kimi-code/blob/f9ca33376/packages/acp-server/src/server.ts#L626-L645)
accepts engine-ready credentials, with an OAuth-summary fallback.
`session/new { cwd, mcpServers, additionalDirectories? }` returns an
engine-generated `sessionId`, `configOptions`, and `modes`.

**What the runtime advertises (0.42.0):** `initialize` answers `loadSession:
true`, `sessionCapabilities` `list`/`resume`/`close`/`delete`/`fork`/
`additionalDirectories`, `promptCapabilities` image + embeddedContext (no
audio), `mcpCapabilities` http + sse, and one auth method `login`
(`type: "terminal"`, a device-code flow OAR never starts). `session/new`
answers `sessionId`, `configOptions` (`model`, `thinking`, `mode` with
`default`/`plan`/`auto`/`yolo`) and `modes` (the same four); the model
catalog and `thinking` values are under
[Models](#models-instructions-and-context).

**Mapped:** OAR launches `kimi acp` (initialize declares `fs` read/write
`false`, `terminal: true`, `clientInfo` `oar`), selects the advertised `login`
method, passes `mcpServers: []`, applies a requested model through
`session/set_model`, then selects yolo through `session/set_mode` when the
answer advertises it (in `modes` or the `mode` config option). Every opening
request has a 30-second deadline; spawn, auth, and creation failures reject
session construction with the process killed. The opening stream is six
records: `initialize`, `authenticate` (`{}`), `session/new` (model event),
then three pushes: `available_commands_update` (the slash commands, `compact`
first) right after the `session/new` answer, and `current_mode_update`
(`yolo`) plus `config_option_update` (model event again) between the
`session/set_mode` request and its `{}` answer. Opening takes about 1.9 s
(`basic`). Credentials and persisted sessions must be accessible in the
subprocess's configured data root.

**Resume (mapped):** native `session/resume { sessionId, cwd, mcpServers,
additionalDirectories? }` restores the existing session and returns
`configOptions` and `modes` **without history replay**; `session/load` has the
same request shape but awaits ordered history `session/update` notifications
before responding (history is not a response messages array). The
[handlers](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/kimi-code/blob/f9ca33376/packages/acp-server/src/server.ts#L296-L322)
ignore `cwd`, warn and ignore `additionalDirectories`, and pass MCP settings
to restore; [cold restore](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/kimi-code/blob/f9ca33376/packages/acp-server/src/server.ts#L533-L570)
can apply those ephemeral servers, already-live sessions pass through.
Unknown IDs return `invalid_params` (`-32602`); missing authentication returns
`auth_required` (`-32000`). Neither creates a substitute session.

Because the handlers ignore `cwd`, a resume that names another directory runs
in the session's own: live (2.1.1, 2026-10-03), a resume naming B ran its
shell as `cd <A> && pwd`. OAR therefore (profile flag
`resumeKeepsSessionCwd`) pages through the advertised `session/list` before
resuming, without recording it, and when the session is listed under another
directory `session()` rejects with an `UnsupportedOptionError` on `cwd` whose
message names both directories ([resume in another directory](resume-cwd.md),
[test](../../tests/acp/acp-resume-cwd.test.ts)).

```ts
const resumed = await kimiRuntime.session(installation, {
  cwd,
  resume: previousSessionId, // Exact earlier Session.id, not an agent/turn ID.
});
const next = resumed.prompt("Continue");
```

OAR selects `session/resume` when `sessionCapabilities.resume` is `true` or
an object, otherwise `session/load` when `loadSession === true`, otherwise
rejects; it does not retry a failed resume as load. The resume answer carries
`configOptions` + `modes` only (no `sessionId`, nothing replayed on the wire);
the resumed stream restarts at seq 0 with the same six-record opening,
`session/resume` in place of `session/new`, and `Session.id` is the supplied
earlier id. The next prompt recalls what was taught before disposal (`resume`
scenario: a codeword). No Turn handle or transcript is restored; history
pushed during a `session/load` opening is not retained. Concurrent same-ID
controllers and continuing in-flight work across OAR subprocesses are
**unverified**.

The Node SDK separately offers
[`harness.resumeSession({ id, includeSubagents?, replayTurnLimit?, ... })`](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/kimi-code/blob/f9ca33376/packages/node-sdk/src/types.ts#L222-L237),
which returns a native Session and [reuses/coalesces facades](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/kimi-code/blob/f9ca33376/packages/node-sdk/src/kimi-harness.ts#L166-L225)
for active or identical concurrent resumes inside that harness; ACP uses
`klient.session(id).restore()` and rebuilds its main-agent wrapper. OAR
neither exposes the SDK replay options nor inherits its coalescing guarantee
(source facts, not observed on the 0.38.0 snapshot). Native ACP also
implements session list, delete, and fork; OAR exposes **none** of those (it
reads `session/list` only for the directory check above): resume is neither a
session browser nor a fork API.

### Prompt, steering, queueing, and abort

Native `session/prompt { sessionId, prompt: [{ type: "text", text }] }`
streams updates and returns a `stopReason`. Attachment submits no prompt.
The native ACP driver buffers events arriving before the launch returns a
turn ID and can bind a `session/cancel` request to that eventual ID. Native
ACP accepts image and resource blocks. OAR sends `InputOptions.images` as
`image` blocks (`data`, `mimeType`, the file as `uri`) before the text block,
because `initialize` advertises `promptCapabilities.image`
(`capabilities.images` is read from it). Probed live (kimi 2.0.0, model
`kimi-code/k3`, 2026-09-29): asked for the color of a plain green PNG named
`probe.png`, it answered `green`, its reasoning describing "a solid green
square".

**Prompt (mapped):** `prompt(string)` records a prompt request answered
`accepted` once the RPC is on the wire, or `rejected` (`busy` during a turn,
as in `busy-and-late-control`; the transport error when the process is gone). The
RPC answer is recorded as frame `session/prompt` with the `turn_ended`
event; an RPC error answer as `session/prompt/error` with a failed end
([test](../../tests/acp/acp-session.test.ts)).

**Steer (not available on this transport):** the native SDK and agent
services support steering, but the ACP method set has no steer operation, so
the session has no `steer`: a host reads the absent member, not a runtime
name. `steerOrQueue()` and `deliver()` therefore queue: the queue request is
accepted and the input runs after the current turn; no steer request is
recorded (`kimi-steer-or-queue.ts`, run against kimi 0.42.0 and 2.0.0 when
`steer()` still existed and was rejected before the queue).

**Queue (mapped):** `queue()` is a host-memory FIFO
(`capabilities.queue.durable: false`, no claim about native queue
durability), drained one input per turn end; the drained input runs as a
spontaneous turn with its own `session/prompt` answer and no prompt request
of its own (`queue`). Held input is dropped once the runtime is unreachable.
`withdraw(inputId)` takes an input out of the FIFO before it is prompted
(`accepted`) and answers `not_queued` after; kimi's `session/cancel` targets
the running turn, not held input ([input cancellation](input-cancellation.md),
[test](../../tests/acp/acp-session-withdraw.test.ts)).

**Abort (mapped):** `abort()` sends `session/cancel` (a notification, so
the `accepted` answer carries no `native`) and is `rejected no active
turn` after the turn. Kimi then asks the client to `terminal/kill` the running
command, `wait_for_exit` answers `SIGTERM`, the tool ends `status: "failed"`,
and the prompt answers `stopReason: "cancelled"` about one second later,
recorded as `turn_ended: aborted` (`abort`). If the cancelled prompt is not
answered within ten seconds OAR kills the process and the `exited` response
is the turn's end; the fallback has not been needed live. Kimi still pushes
the turn's `usage_update` after a cancelled answer (about 1 ms later); the
usage gate does not wait while aborting, so on an aborted turn that record
lands after the turn end. Effects on background children are **unverified**.

**Outcomes:** native ACP [maps most non-auth failures to `end_turn`](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/kimi-code/blob/f9ca33376/packages/acp-server/src/events-map.ts#L59-L74);
blocked/filtered cases become `refusal`, while auth failures use the RPC
error channel. OAR's `turn_ended` event maps `cancelled` to aborted and every
other stop reason to completed; the answer itself is in the event's `native`,
so a consumer can still read `refusal` or any other stop reason. This
separates loss before OAR receives a response (native) from OAR's reading
(the event). Opening with an unknown model makes `session/set_model` answer a
JSON-RPC error `-32603 "Internal error"` with `data.details` `Model "<id>" is
not configured in config.toml.`; session construction rejects with the SDK's
`RequestError` (message `Internal error`, the details on its `data`) and no
OAR session or log exists (`bad-model`).

**Unreachable runtime:** `dispose()` mid-turn runs the cancel path, then
`session/close` (advertised; answered `{}`), then the kill; the dispose
request is answered by the `exited` response (`dispose-mid-turn`). The exit
code is `null` (signal), except when the process exits `0` on `session/close`
before the kill (seen once, `subagent`). When `kimi acp` dies on its own
(SIGKILL mid-turn), the stream gets an `exited` response with `requestId ""`
and `code: null`, which is the turn's end (read as failed /
`runtime_exited`); a later `prompt()` is rejected and a later `dispose()` is a
request answered `accepted` without further work (`kill-runtime`;
[test](../../tests/acp/acp-kimi-wire-shapes.test.ts)).

### Observation, children, and history

**Mapped:** every update is a frame with `native` verbatim; events carry
text (`agent_message_chunk` → `text_delta`), reasoning, tool boundaries,
context snapshots, and model reports. Reasoning arrives as
`agent_thought_chunk` text deltas ending with an empty chunk (`reasoning:
empty`); `session_info_update` (the session title) is recorded with no events
after each first prompt. Native `${turnId}:${toolCallId}` wire IDs survive as
call IDs. Detail strings truncate at 10,000 characters (`native` does not);
tool progress/status distinctions are in `native` only; a tool the runtime
never ended gets no synthetic end. Kimi reports no retry through ACP, so
`retry` never appears. `Session.usage().total` stays `null`: no frame carries
token totals, only `usage_update` context.

**Tool frames:** the opening `tool_call` carries `title`, `kind`
(`execute` for `Bash`, `other` for `Agent`), `status: "pending"`, an empty
`content` text block, and no `rawInput`, so `tool_call_started` has no
`input`. The arguments then stream as partial-JSON `content` text over a
dozen `tool_call_update` frames with no event (`content` while `in_progress`
is input, not output, so it is never read as `tool_call_progress`; only an
update carrying `rawOutput` would be), and one more update carries the full
`rawInput` (`{"command": …}`) with `title` "Running: …". The command runs
through `terminal/create` (`/bin/bash -c "cd '<cwd>' && …"`, env `NO_COLOR`,
`TERM=dumb`, …), `wait_for_exit`, `output`, `release`, each a `toApp` request
with OAR's answer; the captured output is in the `terminal/output` answer.
The completed frame's `content` is a terminal reference
(`{type: "terminal", terminalId}`) with no `rawOutput`, so
`tool_call_ended.content` is that reference as an `other` part, not the command's text
(`tool-detail`). The `tool` label is the opening `tool_call` frame's `title`
rather than the ACP `kind` category; for the two tools observed live (`Bash`,
`Agent`) that title is the tool's name; whether every kimi tool opens with its
name as `title` is **unverified**. A call first seen on a `tool_call_update`
(whose `title` is progress text) is labelled by `kind`; an explicit
`name`/`toolName` always wins
([test](../../tests/acp/acp-kimi-wire-shapes.test.ts)).

**Children (transport-limited, `opaque`):** the
[native child schema](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/kimi-code/blob/f9ca33376/packages/protocol/src/events.ts#L878-L927)
contains `subagentId`, `parentToolCallId`, optional `parentAgentId`, and
`runInBackground`; completion can carry usage and context tokens. ACP
subscribes to `main`, so children never reach OAR and the adapter fabricates
nothing. Asked to delegate one shell command, the root runs an `Agent` tool
call whose arguments stream as `content` text (`prompt`, `description`,
`subagent_type: "coder"`); the child's own Bash call surfaces ONLY as the
root session's `terminal/create` → `wait_for_exit` → `output` → `release`
reverse requests, under the root `sessionId`: no `session/update` for the
child, no `tool_call` frame for its Bash. The Agent call's completed frame
carries the child's report as `rawOutput` (`agent_id: agent-0`,
`actual_subagent_type: coder`, `status: completed`, a `resume_hint` naming
`Agent(resume="agent-0")`). Every record carries the root `sessionId`,
`agentPath` is `[]` throughout, and the graph has one node (`subagent`). A
root `Agent` tool card is not a child trajectory. OAR does not filter by
session id: should a future `kimi acp` emit updates for other session ids,
they would be recorded as child-session records. (The `isFromMainAgent`
guard lives in the older `acp-adapter` package; this baseline uses
`acp-server` with scoped subscriptions; see the
[runtime matrix](../spec/runtime-matrix.md).)

**History:** the retained stream backs `rawEvents(observer, cursor)` for the
life of the process (`cursor`); there is no native-history enumeration and
no rebuild after the process died.

### Models, instructions, and context

Native ACP config options cover model, thinking, and mode, with
`session/set_model` retained as an extension. Every switch pushes
`config_option_update` before the switch request is answered, and the
`set_model` answer is `{}`.

**Mapped:** open-time model selection (`SessionOptions.model` →
`session/set_model`) and early config-update readback: `Session.model()` is
the latest `model` event, read from `configOptions` id `model` on the open
answer and from every `config_option_update`, never from the request
parameter. The
[model lister](../../packages/oar/src/runtimes/kimi/list-models.ts) creates a
temporary authenticated session (`terminal: false`), reads the `model`
config option, closes and kills it; the `thinking` option (found by its
`thought_level` category, as the session finds it) is emitted only for the
current model, so effort levels attach to that entry only (`off` is a
toggle and dropped). A `-32601` error reads as unsupported, `-32000` or an
auth message as unauthenticated. On this account the 0.42.0 catalog is
`kimi-k2.5`, `kimi-code/kimi-for-coding`, `kimi-code/kimi-for-coding-highspeed`,
`kimi-code/k3` (current, thinking `high`), `kimi-code/k3-256k`.

**Effort (mapped).** kimi's effort is the `thinking` config option in
ACP's `thought_level` category ([env] 2.0.0: low/high/max on k3, while
kimi-k2.5 offers off/on/low). `SessionOptions.effort` is
`session/set_config_option {configId: "thinking", value}`, sent after
`session/set_model`, which re-derives the option's menu for the new model
and keeps a level the new menu still has. kimi pushes a
`config_option_update`, then answers with every option's current value;
both carry the `effort` event, and a `currentValue` other than the request
refuses the open. An unknown value is refused `-32602 "Invalid params:
Unknown thinking value: bogus"`, so the open rejects with that message.
The level persists with the session: a resume answers the level last set
(live 2026-09-29: `low`), and a resume that asks for none keeps it
(`high` after a `high` run). The native record is the agent's wire log
(`~/.kimi-code/sessions/…/agents/main/wire.jsonl`): `config.update
{thinkingEffort}`, then each `llm.request` carries `thinkingEffort` (live:
`low` on the first turn, `high` after the resume). Live changes on a
running session are absent ([native surfaces](live-configure.md)).
[ACP effort channel](../../packages/oar/src/shared/acp/effort.ts),
[test](../../tests/acp/acp-session-effort.test.ts).

`session()` refuses `systemPrompt` and `appendSystemPrompt` with an
`UnsupportedOptionError`, declared before open in
`kimiRuntime.refusedSessionOptions`, because the selected ACP integration
exposes no override
([refused session options](../spec/runtime-matrix.md#refused-session-options)).
This is not a claim that the native harness cannot configure instructions.

**Context (partial):** native ACP
[emits context usage after the prompt response](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/kimi-code/blob/f9ca33376/packages/acp-server/src/session.ts#L907-L947)
from an un-awaited task and may omit it when the catalog has no size for the
model. OAR holds the `session/prompt` answer event at most 500 ms for that
push (`usageUpdateAfterPrompt`), then records the answer as-is; this keeps
the usage record before the turn end but is not a freshness guarantee. Live
the push follows the answer by about 8 ms, so `contextUsage()` at
`turn_ended` reads the turn's own value, growing across turns, e.g.
`[20611, 20657]` (`kimi-usage-update-order.ts live`). `size` is `1048576` for
`kimi-code/k3`; a one-word turn already occupies about 20.6k tokens (the
system prompt). Per-agent usage remains unexposed.

Native agent compaction exists; ACP
[`/compact` dispatches a background task](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/kimi-code/blob/f9ca33376/packages/acp-server/src/builtin-commands.ts#L100-L110).
OAR has no typed compact operation, and no ACP frame reports a compaction,
so Kimi sessions never carry `compaction_started` or `compaction_ended`
events. Prompt text can reach that slash route, but completion text emitted
after the OAR Turn ends is dropped; prompt completion does not establish
compaction completion.

### Tools, permissions, and extensions

Native ACP accepts MCP configuration and supports filesystem, terminal, and
interaction reverse calls; its permission channel handles tool approvals and
question fallback. OAR's [client](../../packages/oar/src/shared/acp/terminal.ts)
hosts terminals (`create`, `output`, `wait_for_exit`, `kill`, `release`, run
in the session `cwd` with the env overlay, output capped at 4 MiB by
default), disables client filesystem methods, and passes no MCP servers.
Vendor-configured tools can still run, but OAR has no per-session MCP
configuration or generic client-tool callback.

OAR uses yolo when available and answers `session/request_permission` with
`allow_always`, then `allow_once`, otherwise `cancelled`. With yolo selected
no `request_permission` arrives; the only reverse requests are `terminal/*`,
and while a command runs kimi polls `terminal/output` every ~250 ms, each poll
a `toApp` request/answer pair, terminal output included
(`busy-and-late-control`, `kimi-wire-tap.ts`). No caller decision channel
exists, so approval and question semantics cannot be represented as
application interactions; the stream shows what was asked and what OAR
answered.

### Process ownership, installation, and account usage

**Mapped:** OAR owns the spawned process. Native ACP close tears down a live
session; delete is a separate operation. Disposal cancels active work,
attempts the advertised `session/close`, kills the process, and disposes
hosted terminals. On POSIX the process and each hosted terminal command
lead their own process groups, so `terminal/kill`, release, and disposal reach
what they started, and a runtime still running a grace period after SIGTERM
(10 s, or `OAR_KILL_GRACE_MS`) is SIGKILLed with its group
([test](../../tests/session-dispose.test.ts)). It does not delete persisted
native sessions.

[Installation detection](../../packages/oar/src/runtimes/kimi/installation.ts)
checks `OAR_KIMI_BIN`, PATH `kimi`, `$KIMI_INSTALL_DIR/bin/kimi`,
`~/.kimi-code/bin/kimi`, and the legacy `kimi-code` name, probing
`kimi acp --help` with 30-second timeouts; it does not prove compatibility
with Python kimi-cli.

`checkUpdate` reads the release pointer kimi's own updater installs from, and
`upgrade` runs `kimi upgrade -y`; a kimi older than 0.43.0 has no
non-interactive upgrade, so `upgrade` answers `unsupported`
`requires_terminal` ([runtime updates](update.md)).

[Account usage](../../packages/oar/src/runtimes/kimi/account-usage.ts)
resolves the managed `kimi-code` provider through `kimi provider list --json`
(honouring `KIMI_CODE_BASE_URL`, `KIMI_CODE_OAUTH_HOST`, `KIMI_CODE_HOME`),
reads the stored OAuth token as-is (never refreshed), and calls the `/usages`
and `/me` endpoints; 401/403 or a missing token read `reauth_required`, 404
`unsupported`. [`/me`](../../packages/oar/src/runtimes/kimi/profile.ts) is a
best-effort identity add-on: it supplies `plan` (`user_level_name`), `email`,
and `displayName` (`nickname`). Phone or WeChat sign-ins return no `email`, so
`displayName` is often their only readable identity. Account quota and
session context occupancy are distinct APIs; neither supplies the missing
child-agent usage stream.

## Verification and open gaps

[`experiments/live-contract.ts kimi`](../../experiments/live-contract.ts)
covers the promises above on the real login: `basic`, `multi-turn`,
`tool-detail`, `busy-and-late-control`, `steer` (now skipped: the session
has no `steer`), `queue`, `abort`, `dispose-mid-turn`, `cursor`, `resume`,
`subagent`, `kill-runtime`, `bad-model`. [`kimi-wire-tap.ts`](../../experiments/kimi-wire-tap.ts) checks
the raw JSON-RPC below the SDK against the record stream: one shell-tool turn
is outbound `initialize`, `authenticate`, `session/new`, `session/set_mode`,
`session/prompt`, `session/close`, all answered; inbound 49 `session/update`
notifications (`available_commands_update` 1, `current_mode_update` 1,
`config_option_update` 1, `session_info_update` 1, `agent_thought_chunk` 22,
`tool_call` 1, `tool_call_update` 14, `agent_message_chunk` 7, `usage_update`
1) and four `terminal/*` requests (no vendor extension notification, no
unknown method), every one reaching the stream with the same count
(`missingFromStream: []`).
[`kimi-usage-update-order.ts`](../../experiments/kimi-usage-update-order.ts)
separates fixture and live modes;
[`kimi-steer-or-queue.ts`](../../experiments/kimi-steer-or-queue.ts) covers
`steerOrQueue()`.

[ACP tests](../../tests/acp/acp-session.test.ts) and
[model/usage tests](../../tests/acp/acp-session-model-usage.test.ts) use a fake
executable for the record skeleton, control accept/reject, early model
updates, and late/missing usage updates (the usage record is deliberately
held before the turn end).
[Wire-shape tests](../../tests/acp/acp-kimi-wire-shapes.test.ts) pin the
0.42.0 tool frames (title-only opening, late `rawInput`, terminal-reference
completion, the Agent report) and the dispose-after-death answer.
[Snapshot tests](../../tests/acp/acp-vendor-snapshot.test.ts) bind login and
yolo selection to the recorded 0.38.0 schema. The
[real-runtime CI matrix](../../.github/workflows/ci.yml) excludes Kimi.

Open gaps: questions and approvals (no `request_permission` arrives under
yolo), post-turn compaction, whether every kimi tool opens with its name as
`title`, abort effects on background children, concurrent same-ID
controllers and in-flight work across OAR subprocesses, and any child usage
(the transport carries none). Keep native API capabilities, transport
limitations, OAR omissions, and unexecuted checks separate when designing or
claiming support.
