# Live model and effort changes

Local probes, 2026-09-29: claude 2.1.284, codex-cli 0.155.1, grok 1.0.41,
kimi 2.0.0, pi SDK 0.84.2. Reproduction:
[experiments/effort-channels.ts](../../experiments/effort-channels.ts). These
are native facts for a later `Session.configure` design; nothing here is
implemented.

**The question.** Which native surface changes the model and/or reasoning
effort of a *running* session between turns without restarting the runtime
process, and how would that meet each adapter's queue? OAR applies both at
open only (`SessionOptions.model` / `effort`, read back against the runtime's
own report). A host switching mid-conversation disposes the Session at a turn
boundary and resumes the native id with new options: a process restart and a
new handshake, where claude also re-runs its SessionStart hooks and every
runtime starts its MCP servers again.

## What each runtime offers

| Runtime | Model, live | Effort, live | The runtime's word afterwards | Queue that a change must be ordered against |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| claude 2.1.284 | control request `set_model {model}` | control request `apply_flag_settings {settings: {effortLevel}}` (`set_max_thinking_tokens` is the older budget knob) | both answered `success` only; `get_settings.applied.{model, effort}` then reports the change | adapter-held (OAR drains one message per turn end by writing stdin) |
| codex 0.155.1 | `thread/settings/update {threadId, model}` (experimental API, which OAR enables; OAR already uses it at open to set a resumed thread's effort) | `thread/settings/update {threadId, effort}` | reply `{}`, then `thread/settings/updated {threadSettings: {model, effort, ...}}` | native (`thread/queue/add`): a drained submission runs the thread's current settings |
| grok 1.0.41 | `session/set_model` or `session/set_config_option {configId: "model"}` | `session/set_config_option {configId: "reasoning_effort"}` | the answer's `configOptions` (current values), a `config_option_update` push, and `_x.ai/session_notification model_changed {model_id, reasoning_effort}` | adapter-held (OAR drains one prompt per turn end) |
| kimi 2.0.0 | `session/set_model` (also a `model` config option) | `session/set_config_option {configId: "thinking"}` | the answer's `configOptions` and a `config_option_update` push | adapter-held |
| pi SDK 0.84.2 | `AgentSession.setModel(model)` | `AgentSession.setThinkingLevel(level)` | `thinking_level_changed {level}`; `AgentSession.model` / `thinkingLevel` getters | adapter-held (OAR starts the next held input at `agent_settled`) |
| cursor `@cursor/sdk` 1.0.35 (SDK types only, not probed) | `agent.send(message, { model })`, per run | the same selection's reasoning parameter (`effort`, `reasoning` or `reasoning_effort` by model family) | `agent.model`, updated after each successful `send({ model })`; each `run.wait()` answers with the run's `model` | adapter-held (OAR sends the next held input as a new run when the current one ends) |

Probed, token-free:

- **claude:** on one idle process opened with `--model sonnet --effort low`,
  `set_model opus` moved `get_settings.applied` to `claude-opus-5-5` / `low`,
  `apply_flag_settings {effortLevel: "high"}` to `high`, and `set_model haiku`
  to `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` / `null` (the model takes no effort). Every
  answer was a bare `success`, including `apply_flag_settings` with an unknown
  level, so only a `get_settings` read-back tells what took effect.
  `system/init` says `per_turn_effort_active: true`: claude sends an effort
  change inside the conversation at the turn where it changes, keeping the
  prompt cache (`system/per_turn_effort_changed` reports a fallback).
  `update_settings` writes settings *files* and is not a session setter.
- **codex (aimock provider):** between two turns of one thread,
  `thread/settings/update {effort: "high"}` answered `{}`, codex pushed
  `thread/settings/updated` with `effort: "high"`, and both the next prompted
  turn's Responses request and the turn codex started from its own queue
  afterwards carried `reasoning.effort: "high"`. `thread/queue/add` takes no
  per-submission overrides (`threadId`, `input`, `clientUserMessageId`).
  `turn/start` also takes `model` / `effort` ("for this turn and subsequent
  turns"); `turn/settings/update {turnId, model, effort}` changes one
  *running* turn only ("not future turns"). `config/value/write` edits
  `config.toml` and is not a session setter. Nor is a `config` override on
  `thread/resume`: it rebuilds the thread's settings from `config.toml`, so a
  resume that does not repeat `model` switches to the configured default
  (live: `gpt-6-luna` came back as `gpt-6-astra`), and the rebuild stays with
  the thread even without a turn. `thread/settings/update` to the level a
  thread already runs pushes nothing.
- **grok, kimi:** `session/set_config_option` works on an idle session, with
  no prompt needed. A model switch re-derives the effort option's menu for
  the new model (grok-4.5 offers high/medium/low where grok-4.7 adds xhigh;
  kimi-k2.5 offers off/on/low where k3 offers low/high/max), keeping a level
  the new menu still has. An unknown value is refused `-32602 Invalid params`.
- **pi:** both setters write pi's *global* settings as the user's new default
  (`settingsManager.setDefaultModelAndProvider`, `setDefaultThinkingLevel`
  when the level changes; agent-session.js 0.84.2), besides appending
  `model_change` / `thinking_level_change` to the session file.
  `setThinkingLevel` clamps to the model's levels as creation does.

Not probed anywhere: a change *during* a turn (claude and ACP accept the
request at any time, but when it reaches the running model calls is unknown;
codex's `turn/settings/update` is the one surface documented for it), and a
change racing a queued input.

## What a `Session.configure` would have to settle

- **A control like the others.** A `configure` request record answered by
  the runtime's own acknowledgement. The effect is the `model` / `effort`
  events the runtime then says, never the request echoed (the rule the
  open-time read-back follows). claude acknowledges with a bare `success`,
  and its only report is `get_settings`, whose answer also dumps the merged
  settings. It would be consumed unrecorded, as at open
  ([decision](../design/decisions.md#recording-claudes-effort-read-back-2026-09-29)),
  and claude's `effort()` would stay null.
- **Turn boundaries and queues.** A change applied while idle must still be
  ordered against queued input. On the adapter-held queues (claude, grok,
  kimi, pi, cursor) the adapter drains the next held input at the turn end, so a
  configure accepted before a drain must be sent (and answered) before that
  drain's prompt; a configure issued mid-turn waits for the boundary or is
  refused `busy`. Codex holds its queue natively and `thread/settings/update`
  already governs a drained submission, so there the ordering is codex's own.
- **Where the setter has side effects.** pi's setters rewrite the user's
  global defaults; a configure through them would need that accepted as pi's
  semantics or avoided by other means. The restart path passes creation-time
  options, which write only the session file.
- **Resume semantics stay separate.** Asked for nothing, codex, grok and kimi
  restore the level the session last ran with; pi restores the level its
  session file recorded, and an explicit level on resume is not recorded;
  claude restores none; a resumed cursor agent restores no model, so OAR
  reopens it with its latest run's selection (`Agent.listRuns`,
  [model.ts](../../packages/oar/src/runtimes/cursor/model.ts)). A configure would change the running session; what the
  next resume restores remains each runtime's rule and belongs in its page.
