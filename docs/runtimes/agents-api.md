# OpenAI Agents API: reference runtime

**OAR has no Agents API adapter.** Reviewed **2026-09-12** from the public-beta
documentation (released 2026-09-10 per the [API changelog][changelog]) and the
API reference pages linked below, plus live runs on **2026-09-12**
(`gpt-6-astra`, project API key, macOS) of
[`experiments/agents-api-probe.ts`](../../experiments/agents-api-probe.ts)
(`environment: none`, twice),
[`experiments/agents-api-sandbox-probe.ts`](../../experiments/agents-api-sandbox-probe.ts)
(`openai_hosted`, a `none` session with a function tool, and a `self_hosted`
run) and
[`experiments/agents-api-executor-probe.ts`](../../experiments/agents-api-executor-probe.ts)
(the `self_hosted` executor's lifecycle). Claims are tagged [doc] or [env];
where they disagree, the [env] observation is stated and the doc claim kept
for contrast. The announcement page returns 403 to non-browser fetchers and
is not cited.

The Agents API is the first vendor-managed placement of a runtime OAR already
wraps (Codex), so it is the concrete case for
[hard problem 15](../design/hard-problems.md#beyond-a-single-local-process),
and its object model independently corroborates several spec positions. Both
are collected under [Design input for OAR](#design-input-for-oar).

## Native concepts and calling interfaces

### Core concepts

OpenAI runs the Codex harness (model calls, tools, subagents, context
compaction, recovery); the application supplies input, tools, and the
execution environment.

| Concept | Native meaning |
|---|---|
| Agent | Model, instructions, tools (function / `mcp` / `web_search` / `programmatic_tool_calling` / `tool_search`), `multi_agent` settings, reasoning and text options. Either inline on the session or saved via `POST /v1/agents` and referenced as `agent_id`; a per-session `agent` override replaces whole fields, it does not merge. |
| Environment | Where commands run and files live: `none`, `openai_hosted` (a Linux sandbox at `/workspace`, provisioned by OpenAI, idle-expires after one hour, not configurable), or `self_hosted` (the application runs `codex exec-server` inside its own compute; the executor registers with an environment id and a restricted `CODEX_API_KEY`, then holds an outbound WebSocket to `codex-cloud-environments.chatgpt.com`). A session can outlive its environment; the coordinator and its subagents share one filesystem. |
| Session | The durable unit: agent configuration, conversation, saved work. `status` is `idle` / `in_progress` / `requires_action` / `failed`. Carries `required_actions` (`function_call`, `environment_connection`), cumulative `usage`, `environment`, and `metadata`. |
| Turn | One cycle of work. `status` is `queued` / `in_progress` / `waiting` (blocked on the application) / `completed` / `failed` / `cancelled`. Carries `subagent_id` (null for the root agent), best-effort `usage`, and `error`. Listed and retrieved via `/sessions/{id}/turns`. |
| Item | Saved output, paginated (`after` / `limit` / `order`, `has_more` / `last_id`). Types: `message`, `reasoning`, `function_call`, `function_call_output`, `mcp_call`, `command_execution`, `web_search_call`, `agent_message`, and the subagent coordination calls `create_subagent_call`, `send_subagent_input_call`, `wait_for_subagents_call`, `interrupt_subagent_call`, `resume_subagent_call`, `close_subagent_call`. Root items live under `/sessions/{id}/items`; each subagent has its own history under `/sessions/{id}/subagents/{sid}/items` and per-turn items. |
| Event | Both directions. **Input events** are POSTed to `/sessions/{id}/events`: `agent.session.input.message`, `agent.session.input.cancel`, `agent.session.input.tool_result`. **Output events** stream (SSE, header `OpenAI-Beta: agents=v1`) from `GET /sessions/{id}/events?stream=true`, or from `POST /sessions` with `stream: true` for the first turn. |
| Subagent | Created by harness-supplied tools when `agent.multi_agent.enabled` is true (`max_concurrent_subagents`, default 6). Object: `{id, session_id, name, instructions, parent_agent_id, status, opened_at, closed_at}`. Subagents inherit MCP tools and web search, share the environment, and cannot use function tools. |
| Webhook | Content-free state notifications for `agent.session.created` / `action_required` / `in_progress` / `idle` / `failed`; the handler must retrieve the session to learn details. |

### The output event vocabulary

Thirty event types are documented. Every event carries `event_id`; most
carry `session_id` and a nullable `turn_id`; text and reasoning deltas add
`item_id` / `output_index` / `content_index`.

| Group | Events |
|---|---|
| Session lifecycle | `agent.session.created`, `.in_progress`, `.idle`, `.requires_action`, `.failed` (each carries the full session object) |
| Environment | `agent.session.environment.pending`, `.ready`, `.connected`, `.disconnected`, `.failed` |
| Turn lifecycle | `agent.session.turn.created`, `.in_progress`, `.completed`, `.failed`, `.cancelled` (each carries the turn object; the three terminal ones also carry `usage`) |
| Items | `agent.session.turn.item.added`, `.item.done`, `.content_part.added`, `.content_part.done` |
| Text and reasoning | `agent.session.turn.output_text.delta` / `.done`, `agent.session.turn.reasoning_summary_part.added` / `.done`, `agent.session.turn.reasoning_summary_text.delta` / `.done` |
| Command output | `agent.output.command_execution_output.delta` |
| Subagents | `agent.session.subagent.created`, `.active`, `.closed` |
| Stream | `error` |

No event carries a sequence number, and no reference page mentions a cursor,
`Last-Event-ID`, or replay: "Streams do not replay missed events." Recovery
is a procedure the application runs: open a new stream, buffer, list items,
restore state keyed by item id, drop buffered updates for items already
final, resume. [doc: events] [env]: the SSE carries no `id:` lines and
`event_id` values are random, not orderable, so there is nothing to resume
from. `POST /sessions` with `stream: true` ends with EOF after the first
turn's `agent.session.idle`; later turns need a separate
`GET …/events?stream=true`.

[env] Stream order is not causal order. In the subagent run,
`agent.session.subagent.created` arrived before the root
`agent.session.turn.created` that spawned it (twice, the second copy with
`instructions` filled in), and `agent.session.subagent.closed` arrived before
the `create_subagent_call` item was added. The coordination items came as one
burst seven seconds after the subagent was created, after it had closed.

### Control semantics

- **Prompt and steer are the same message.** "A message sent to an idle
  session starts a new turn. A message sent during an active turn steers
  that turn." The server decides by its own state; the caller sets no
  precondition (contrast codex `turn/steer {expectedTurnId}`). [doc: sessions]
  [env]: the steer lands at the next step boundary, like claude. A message
  POSTed while `sleep 25; echo FIRST` ran was absorbed into that turn: the
  second command never ran, the final text was the steered reply, the steer
  message item sits in that turn, and no new `turn.created` came. With no
  step boundary (a 40-line count in one generation) the same POST ran as the
  next turn. Both answer 202 with an empty body, so only the stream tells
  which happened.
- **Queue, undocumented.** The lifecycle page says the input-time connection
  wait "does not provide a durable input queue" and the API "does not
  guarantee recovery of pending input after a process crash".
  [doc: lifecycle] [env]: a mid-turn message was held server-side and run as
  the next turn, so an idle or running session does queue; the doc caveat
  concerns the environment-connection wait.
- **Cancel is an input event**, `agent.session.input.cancel`, on the same
  endpoint as messages; the outcome is `agent.session.turn.cancelled`.
  [doc: sessions] [env]: cancelling a running `sleep 120` gave `item.done`
  with the command `status: "incomplete"`, then `turn.cancelled` 4.2 s after
  the POST, then `idle`; the turn retrieves as `cancelled` with `error` null,
  and the incomplete command item is absent from the items list afterwards.
  A cancel on an idle session is a 202 with an empty body and no event
  (three observations): there is no typed rejection.
- **Turn end is the turn event, never idle.** "An idle session alone does
  not mean the turn succeeded" and "a completed turn does not guarantee
  every tool succeeded" appear on three pages. [doc: sessions, events, webhooks]
- **Runtime-to-app requests are session state.** A function tool call
  surfaces as `agent.session.requires_action` (with `session.status:
  requires_action`) plus `session.required_actions [{type: function_call,
  turn_id, call_id, name, arguments}]`; the turn sits in `waiting`; the app
  answers with `agent.session.input.tool_result {turn_id, call_id, success,
  output | error}`. `environment_connection` is the second required-action
  kind. [doc: functions, manage] [env]: observed as documented with a
  declared function tool; `success: true, output: "<string>"` was accepted
  (202) and the turn completed with `function_call` + `function_call_output`
  items.
- **Environment events are late.** [env]: on an `openai_hosted` session the
  first `turn.created` came at 9.9 s, and the command had run and completed
  before `environment.ready` (30.9 s) and `environment.connected` (33.6 s).
  A reopened stream re-emits `environment.ready` first.
- **Environment connection is a required action, and the input request
  blocks on it.** [env] (self-hosted): input sent with no executor gives
  `agent.session.requires_action` in 1.8 s with
  `required_actions: [{type: environment_connection, environment_id}]`, and
  the `POST /events` itself stays open until an executor connects (202 after
  10.4 s here). When the executor connects in time, the parked input runs
  without resubmission (stream: `requires_action`, `environment.connected`,
  `idle`, then `turn.created`). A client whose proxy cuts that request loses
  the input for good: the session then answered a late executor with `idle`
  and no turn.
- **Executor death is a failed tool, not a failed turn.** [env]: SIGKILL on
  the executor 5 s into `sleep 40` produced `environment.disconnected` 20.6 s
  later, the command `item.done` with `status: failed` and output
  "exec-server transport disconnected; failed to resume exec-server session:
  recovery timed out after 25s", then reasoning, an honest reply, and
  `turn.completed` 51.6 s after the kill with `turn.error` null. A
  replacement executor on the same environment id connected about 80 s after
  starting and ran every later command.
- **Deletion is silent on the stream, leaves the executor running, and can be
  refused.** [env]: `DELETE /sessions/{id}` returns 200 and an open event
  stream ends with a clean EOF (no event, no `error`). With the executor
  connected, its process was still alive 15 s later. A self-hosted session
  whose first turn never ran answers `DELETE` with 409 `conflict_error`
  "session has no durably bound CCA root", also after a cancel and after an
  executor was connected to it; it lingers.
- **Reconnect delivers an item snapshot, not the deltas.** [env]: closing
  the stream mid-command and reopening 5 s later delivered the turn's
  existing items (`item.added` for the user message and the running
  command), then live events, but none of the missed
  `command_execution_output.delta` lines and no further output deltas at all
  on the new stream; `item.done` carried the full output.
- **Command output can lose its first line.** [env]: twice the first line a
  command printed (immediately at start) was absent from both the deltas and
  the saved item's `output`; a line printed 25 s in arrived. Not in the docs;
  treat command output as approximately, not exactly, verbatim.
- **Artifacts.** [env]: `GET /sessions/{id}/artifacts` lists files the turn
  left under `/workspace/outputs` with `turn_id`, `path`, `size_bytes`.
- **Reasoning summaries are real but sparse.** [env]: `reasoning: {effort:
  medium, summary: auto}` produced no reasoning events on a trivial task; a
  `reasoning` item with `reasoning_summary_part.added` /
  `reasoning_summary_text.delta` / `.done` events appeared when the model had
  something to decide (after an executor died mid-command).
- **Compaction is invisible.** The overview promises summarisation of
  previous work; no event or item type in the reference reports it. [doc: overview, ref-events]
- **Usage is best-effort and mutable.** Turn and session usage "can be null
  when unknown, and recorded counts may change as accounting arrives.
  Missing usage does not mean zero usage." Per-agent counts "cover the agent
  itself; they do not include its subagents", and the tracing example shows
  the three agent totals summing to the session total. [doc: observability, tracing]
  [env]: `usage` was null on every terminal turn event (8 of 8). Retrieved
  turns had usage for some turns and null for others, and which turns had it
  changed between reads seconds apart; the session's own `usage` read null
  after four completed turns. The subagent's turn, read from its own turns
  endpoint, carried usage.
- **Model is mandatory.** [env]: omitting `agent.model` without `agent_id`
  is a 400 (`agent.model is required when agent_id is omitted`); a given
  model is echoed as `session.agent.model` on `agent.session.created`.

### Subagent attribution

[doc: multi-agent, observability] Attribution fields sit on the records
themselves: `turn.subagent_id` on turn events (null = root),
`subagent.parent_agent_id` on `agent.session.subagent.created`, `agent_id`
on `create_subagent_call` items, and `sender_agent_id` /
`recipient_agent_id` on `agent_message` and `send_subagent_input_call`.
Coordination items "can omit message content", and "the stream does not
provide a full conversation transcript" of subagents.

[env] The root stream is thinner than that. In a one-subagent turn:

- no turn event with a non-null `subagent_id` reached the root stream, so the
  documented `turn_id → subagent_id` lookup has nothing to key on there; the
  subagent's turn (with usage) exists only under
  `/sessions/{id}/subagents/{sid}/turns`, and the session-level turns list
  holds root turns only;
- zero subagent `output_text.delta` events; the subagent's own messages are
  under `/sessions/{id}/subagents/{sid}/items` (a `user` message with its
  instructions and an `assistant` reply);
- with a sandbox, no subagent `command_execution` items; its commands and
  their output are only under the subagent's `/items` and `/turns`;
- what did arrive: `subagent.created` / `.closed`, and the coordination items
  (`create_subagent_call` with `agent_id`, `agent_message` in both directions
  with `sender_agent_id` / `recipient_agent_id`, `wait_for_subagents_call`,
  `close_subagent_call`), with content present in this run, flushed as a
  burst after the subagent had closed.

The live stream shows that a subagent existed and what was exchanged with it,
not what it did. Its work is a separate paginated resource read after the
fact.

## High-level mapping to OAR

**Prospective** correspondences against today's
[Session contract](../../packages/oar/src/contracts/session.ts), not adapter
behavior. Rows marked *gap* need a contract decision, not just code.

| Native concept | Prospective OAR counterpart |
|---|---|
| Session id (`sess_…`) | `Session.id`; `SessionOptions.resume` reattaches by id with a fresh stream at seq 0, which the spec already promises. No history rebuild: items are a different granularity from events, so "same record replayed twice gets the same seq" is unsatisfiable across a reattach and must not be claimed. |
| Installation | *gap*. Neither `executable` nor `bundled` fits: availability is "an API key with `api.agents.*` permissions is present". `InstallationSnapshot` needs a remote variant, or the probe reports `bundled` and auth failures surface at session start. |
| `SessionOptions.cwd` | *gap*. Meaningless for `none` and `openai_hosted` (always `/workspace`); for `self_hosted` it is the `workspace_directory` of an executor the host runs. The environment choice is a session option OAR does not have. |
| `prompt()` | `POST /events [input.message]` while the adapter's own fold says idle; the 202 is the `accepted` response. The ≤1-active-turn rule must be enforced locally, because the server accepts a mid-turn message with the same 202 and runs it later instead of rejecting `busy`. The root `agent.session.turn.completed` / `.failed` / `.cancelled` becomes `turn_ended` (`completed` / `failed` / `aborted`). |
| `steer()` | Present on the session. A steered and a queued message get the identical 202, so `accepted` means delivered, and where it landed is read off the stream (a later `turn.created` with the message as its first item = queued). This is the claude landing rule, not codex's `expectedTurnId` precondition. |
| `queue()` | The same POST: `capabilities.queue: { durable: true }` (held server-side). The queued turn has no prompt request of its own: a spontaneous turn, the shape codex's native queue already produces. |
| `abort()` | `POST /events [input.cancel]`; 202 is `accepted`, the outcome is the runtime's `turn.cancelled`. A cancel with nothing active is also a 202 that produces nothing, so rejecting it as "no active turn" must be the adapter's own local decision. |
| Output events | One Frame record per SSE event, `type` = the event's `type`, `native` verbatim, `spanId` = `turn_id`. Events: `output_text.delta` → `text_delta`; `reasoning_summary_text.delta` → `reasoning`; `item.added` for `command_execution` / `mcp_call` / `function_call` / `web_search_call` → `tool_call_started`, `item.done` → `tool_call_ended`; terminal turn events → `turn_ended` + `usage`; `agent.session.created` → `model` (from `session.agent.model`). Everything else is a frame with no events. |
| Runtime→app requests | `agent.session.requires_action` with a `function_call` is a `toApp` request; the app's `tool_result` is its response. An adapter declaring no function tools never receives one. `environment_connection` has no OAR counterpart today (*gap*, see placement). |
| Sub-agents | Records that name a subagent (`subagent.created` / `.closed`, coordination items with `sender_agent_id` / `recipient_agent_id`) can carry `agentPath = [subagent_id]`, but the subagent's own work is not on the stream ([Subagent attribution](#subagent-attribution)): the `opaque` tier with a labelled edge, closer to kimi than to codex. `usage().byAgent` cannot be a fold. |
| `contextUsage()` | Always null: no context-window figure is exposed. |
| `dispose()` | *gap*. The session has no process, so nothing exits on its side. Releasing the runtime can only mean closing the SSE subscription; the session persists remotely and stays billable while its sandbox is alive. `DELETE /sessions/{id}` is a separate, destructive act with its own limits (see [Control semantics](#control-semantics)). In the hybrid shape the adapter owns one process, the executor, whose exit is an `environment.disconnected` on the session, not the session's end. The `exited` response is a local-process concept; the nearest remote analogue is `agent.session.failed`, and a stream disconnect is explicitly not death. |
| Cursor | Within the adapter process, the retained log honours `afterSeq` as usual. A live-stream disconnect inside that lifetime loses events the server will not replay. The reconnect snapshot's `item.added` frames are runtime frames and can be recorded as events, but they restate items, they are not the missed deltas; the adapter must not present them as if nothing was lost. How to mark the gap honestly is open (see below). |
| Usage events | Terminal turn events never carried usage ([env]), so a `usage` event cannot come from the stream. A truthful adapter emits none and leaves `usage()` null, or polls the turn resource after the fact and records the answer as its own observation, not as a runtime event. |
| `listModels` / `accountUsage` | Not part of the Agents API; `/v1/models` and the platform dashboard respectively. |

## Design input for OAR

What the Agents API confirms, and what it adds, relative to the
[spec](../spec/README.md) and [design](../design/README.md) pages.

### Confirmations

1. **Control as records on one channel.** Messages, cancels, and tool
   results are `agent.session.input.*` events on the same `/events` resource
   the outputs stream from. A fourth independent vendor for
   [separate channels for control and facts](../design/decisions.md#separate-channels-for-control-and-facts-2026-09-03).
2. **Turn end is the runtime's own event; idle is not success.** Matches the
   "no synthesized turn boundaries" rule and status-as-fold.
3. **No cursor means application-side recovery.** "Streams do not replay
   missed events" plus an item-keyed dedupe procedure is exactly the cost
   [session-graph-and-cursor.md](../spec/session-graph-and-cursor.md)
   predicts, now from the largest vendor rather than from kimi-cli's
   replay-everything.
4. **Attribution is a field on the record, same stream** (as documented; the
   root stream carries less, see [Subagent attribution](#subagent-attribution)).
   `subagent_id` on turns and `parent_agent_id` on subagents; no second
   transport. Leaf-only per-agent usage that sums to the session total is the
   contract's "deduplicated, directly summable" shape.
5. **Runtime→app requests carry their own identity** (`turn_id` + `call_id`),
   answered on the same channel, with the turn parked in `waiting`. Same
   obligation split as OAR's `toApp` request / `answered` response.

### Additions the contract does not yet answer

1. **Environment is a first-class object, separate from the session.** A
   session outlives its environment; connection is a required action the app
   must satisfy; `cwd` is not universal. This is
   [hard problem 15](../design/hard-problems.md#beyond-a-single-local-process)
   made concrete and belongs in the next `SessionCapabilities` revision
   ([open decision 2](../spec/README.md#open-decisions), capability
   declaration).
2. **Release is not termination.** `dispose` bundles "stop observing",
   "interrupt", and "the runtime is gone" because most shipped adapters own
   a process (pi and cursor run in process and answer the dispose `accepted`
   with no exit). A remote session splits them, and the `exited` response
   needs a stated meaning (or an honest absence) for runtimes that never
   exit.
3. **A lossy live stream inside the adapter's lifetime.** The only other
   in-lifetime loss OAR knows is grok's unattached serve mode. Here a
   reconnect is routine and the server discards. The stream needs a way to
   say "records were not observed between here and here" without
   synthesizing them; the current record kinds have no such marker.
4. **Usage facts can be revised.** OAR treats a `usage` event as a fact at
   its `seq`. The Agents API says counts may change after the turn ends and
   arrive only on later resource reads. A fold over the stream is honest only
   if it never claims finality; a correction can enter the stream as a new
   event only if something polls, which OAR does not do.
5. **Compaction happens and is not reported.** External compaction
   continuity is defined in
   [session-graph-and-cursor.md](../spec/session-graph-and-cursor.md): a new
   session's first prompt carries the summary as its input. Runtime-native
   compaction remains an adapter evidence question.
6. **Steer without a precondition.** Prompt and steer share one wire message,
   disambiguated by server state, so the busy/steer race is adjudicated
   remotely with no typed refusal. Evidence for keeping OAR's explicit
   `steer` with a typed rejection (`no_active_turn`, `unsupported`) rather
   than adopting the simpler shape.
7. **Pushed liveness.** Webhooks deliver session state changes (including
   `failed`) with no stream open. For [liveness.md](../design/liveness.md)
   this is a runtime that reports "why" without being asked, the opposite of
   inference from silence; it also shows content-free notification plus
   retrieve as a viable pattern.

## Adapter shape, if built

The [development guide](../development.md#how-to-add-a-new-runtime) rule
applies: probe first, then build on the observations. The best fit for OAR's
coding-agent use is a hybrid: the session is remote, and OAR spawns
`codex exec-server` locally in `cwd` as the `self_hosted` executor. That
restores meaning to `cwd`, `env`, and process exit (the executor's, not the
session's), at the cost of two credentials (the project API key and a
restricted environment key). `none` and `openai_hosted` would be explicit
environment options for hosts that want them.

Transport needs no SDK: `fetch` plus an SSE parser (undici is already a
dependency, Node 24 has `fetch`; set `NODE_USE_ENV_PROXY=1` where the shell
relies on a proxy, since Node's `fetch` ignores it). The probe scripts'
headers hold the observations; the declared capabilities follow the mapping
table above.

The self-hosted hybrid works end to end. [env] A local
`codex exec-server --remote <environment.remote_url> --environment-id <id>`
(codex 0.154.0) authenticating with the project key is refused with
`403 Forbidden: missing required scope api.agents.environments.connect`.
With a restricted environment key (created on the platform's Agents tab) it
registered, `agent.session.environment.connected` was the first event on the
session stream, and the turn ran `/bin/zsh -lc 'pwd && ls | head -5 &&
echo LOCAL-OK'` in this repository's `cwd` with complete output. The
registration URL has the shape
`https://api.openai.com/v1/agents/api/connect/rt_<id>`; the executor is
silent on stdout and stderr while connected. Given the executor lifecycle in
[Control semantics](#control-semantics), the adapter starts the executor
before the first input (or accepts that the input request blocks until it
connects) and kills it on dispose, since `DELETE` does not.

Open: one 202-accepted message was lost in the completed-but-not-idle window
(first sandbox run) and five deliberate attempts did not reproduce it, so it
stays a single unexplained occurrence; how compaction manifests on a long
session; whether anything follows `agent.session.failed` on the stream.
