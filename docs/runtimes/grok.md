# Grok runtime

Independent inventories (2026-09-16): inspect --json skills and configured/compatibility MCP entries. Independent tools queries are unsupported; no ACP session is created.
See the [query contract](../spec/inventory.md) and [native probe evidence](inventory.md).

Evidence baseline: native source
[`grok-build` `bc7f02e`](https://github.com/xai-org/grok-build/tree/bc7f02e)
(Grok 1.0.12); the [wire snapshot](../../tests/replay/fixtures/grok-acp-v1.vendor.json)
is Grok 1.0.5 (`5115b46bc9`, 2026-08-26), the binary the
[adapter experiment](../../experiments/acp-runtime.ts) ran on (2026-08-27).
Live observations come from **grok 1.0.25 (`f7e67d6988e2`)**, darwin arm64,
runtime default model, 2026-09-11, through
[`experiments/live-contract.ts grok`](../../experiments/live-contract.ts)
(scenarios cited as `live-contract/<id>`) and the raw
[`experiments/grok-wire-tap.ts`](../../experiments/grok-wire-tap.ts) below the
SDK ([experiments index](../../experiments/README.md)); facts from later
binaries name their version. Versions are evidence baselines, not a support
range; source-supported claims are not a live check of a newer binary. The
[spec](../spec/README.md) is not current OAR behavior. See the
[runtime index](README.md) for evidence and status conventions.

## Native concepts and calling interfaces

Grok is a coding-agent harness. Its process owns sessions; each session owns
model context, configuration, incoming prompts, tool execution, and persistent
state. The ACP update log, model chat history, metadata, rewind points, and
compaction checkpoints serve different purposes
([native session description](https://github.com/xai-org/grok-build/blob/bc7f02e/crates/codegen/xai-grok-shell/README.md#session-persistence)).

The interactive TUI, headless `grok -p`, and `grok agent stdio` are calling
modes for that harness. OAR uses the last: ACP JSON-RPC over stdio, including
vendor extensions. ACP is bidirectional: Grok can ask its client to execute a
terminal command or decide a permission request while a prompt is running.

A native session ID identifies conversation continuity; a `promptId`, native
turn number, and JSON-RPC request ID have separate roles. Ordinary prompts
enter a delivery queue; `_meta.sendNow` selects immediate dispatch. Subagents
are independent child sessions with their own context, which may inherit
history/configuration, run in the background, and wake a parent.

## High-level mapping to OAR

OAR exposes one ordered record stream per Session
([contract](../../packages/oar/src/contracts/session.ts)). Every ACP frame is
recorded verbatim as a frame's `native`; the cross-runtime `events` are what
OAR read out of it. Control calls are request/response record pairs. The
profile declares `capabilities` `{ queue: { durable: false }, attribution:
"nested", images: true }` and its steer params, so the session has `steer`.

| Native concept or owner | Current OAR mapping |
| --- | --- |
| Grok executable/process | One `grok agent --always-approve --no-leader stdio` subprocess per OAR Session; its exit is an `exited` response record (answering `dispose` when OAR caused it, `requestId ""` when Grok died on its own). |
| Persistent native session | `Session.id` is the native ID; `SessionOptions.resume` attaches by that ID with a fresh stream (seq 0, no history rebuild). |
| Handshake answers | `initialize`, `authenticate`, `session/new`/`resume`/`load`, `session/set_model`, `session/set_config_option` answers are frame records; the model and `reasoning_effort` level they report are `model` and `effort` events, so `Session.model()` and `effort()` are folds. |
| Prompt delivery and native execution | Controls are `toRuntime` requests answered accepted or rejected; each `session/prompt` RPC answer is a frame, the one closing the turn carrying `turn_ended` and `usage`. A steer (`_meta.sendNow`) adds another prompt RPC to the same turn. No `spanId`: no Grok frame carries a turn id. |
| `session/update` notifications | One frame per notification, for every session id; events for message/thought/tool/usage/model updates, none for unknown kinds; nothing is dropped. |
| `_x.ai/*` vendor notifications | Subscribed by name (`GROK_EXTENSION_NOTIFICATIONS`), each recorded verbatim with no events under the session id its envelope names; one naming a parent/child pair links `Session.graph()` (`via: "tool_call"`). |
| Native child sessions | A frame for another session id is a derived child-session record (its own `sessionId` on the envelope, `agentPath []`, a graph node). Attribution tier `nested`. |
| Client-side terminal and permission duties | Every reverse request is a `toApp` request record (verbatim, under the runtime's JSON-RPC id) and OAR's automatic answer the matching `answered` response; terminals are hosted, permissions follow the fixed allow policy. `events()` reads the pair as `app_request` (method as `type`) and `app_answered`. |

The implementation is divided between the [Grok profile](../../packages/oar/src/runtimes/grok/session.ts),
[ACP opening path](../../packages/oar/src/shared/acp/profile.ts),
[session controller](../../packages/oar/src/shared/acp/session.ts),
[record placement](../../packages/oar/src/shared/acp/records.ts),
[turn machinery](../../packages/oar/src/shared/acp/turns.ts),
[event projection](../../packages/oar/src/shared/acp/projection.ts), and
[client app](../../packages/oar/src/shared/acp/client-app.ts).

ACP `tool_call_update` reports `status: "completed" | "failed"` ([src]
ACP schema `ToolCallStatus`); OAR maps those to `tool_call_ended.result:
"ok" | "failed"`, and a non-terminal or missing status leaves the field
absent. "[sym]" below means the name exists in the binary's symbol table but
has never been seen on a live wire.

## Capability details

### Starting, authenticating, and creating a session

Native ACP starts with `initialize { protocolVersion, clientCapabilities,
clientInfo, _meta? }`, followed by `authenticate { methodId }` when needed.
`session/new { cwd, mcpServers, _meta? }` returns a new `sessionId`, model
state, and metadata. Credentials must be available in the runtime environment.

**Mapped:** OAR selects the advertised default auth method
(`_meta.defaultAuthMethodId`) or `cached_token`, and sends noninteractive
startup hints in the `initialize` `_meta` (`clientIdentifier: "oar"`,
`clientType: "generic"`, `startupHints: { nonInteractive, skipGitStatus,
skipProjectLayout }`). It advertises terminal support, disables client
filesystem methods, and gives each opening request a 15-second deadline. The
session request supplies `mcpServers: []` and `_meta: { yoloMode: true }`.
The `authenticate` answer's `_meta` carries the account email and
`subscription_tier`; the `session/new` answer names the model
(`models.currentModelId`). Spawn, auth, and creation errors reject
`grokRuntime.session(...)`; a failed open kills the process before rejecting.

### Resuming, loading, and forking

Native `session/resume { sessionId, cwd, mcpServers, _meta? }` returns
configuration/model state and metadata for the existing ID, with **no
transcript replay and no code restoration**. Extra directories and chat-kind
sessions are rejected in the baseline source version. `session/load` accepts
the same identity/workspace fields but delivers history notifications before
its response. Its `_meta.cursor` can restrict replay; configuration or
`_meta['x.ai/restore_code']` can request checking out the persisted HEAD.
See the [attach policy](https://github.com/xai-org/grok-build/blob/bc7f02e/crates/codegen/xai-grok-shell/src/agent/mvp_agent/session_setup.rs#L120-L153)
and [resume handler](https://github.com/xai-org/grok-build/blob/bc7f02e/crates/codegen/xai-grok-shell/src/agent/mvp_agent/session_setup.rs#L1552-L1575).

With a previously probed available installation, callers use:

```ts
const resumed = await grokRuntime.session(installation, {
  cwd,
  resume: previousSessionId, // Exact earlier Session.id, not a prompt/turn ID.
});
const next = resumed.prompt("Continue");
```

**Mapped:** OAR chooses `session/resume` when
`agentCapabilities.sessionCapabilities.resume` is `true` or an object,
otherwise `session/load` when `loadSession === true`, otherwise rejects
(`ACP runtime does not support session resume`). This is capability
selection, not a retry after a failed resume. An optional model is applied
afterward with `session/set_model`. The `session/resume` answer carries
`models.currentModelId` (a `model` event), preceded by `background_tasks` and
`model_changed` vendor pushes; the resumed session keeps the id, opens at
seq 0, and recalls the earlier transcript (`live-contract/resume`). Grok
itself refuses a resume naming another directory than the session's own:
`session()` rejects with its `Path not found.` (1.0.46, 2026-10-03,
[resume in another directory](resume-cwd.md)). Native
persistence errors carry [stable error data](https://github.com/xai-org/grok-build/blob/bc7f02e/crates/codegen/xai-grok-shell/src/session/persistence.rs#L2496-L2516);
OAR propagates opening failures without a separate resume-error result type.
The 1.0.5 snapshot establishes advertised resume support, not all
newer-source details.

Native resident attachment can report
[`_meta['x.ai/runningPromptId']`](https://github.com/xai-org/grok-build/blob/bc7f02e/crates/codegen/xai-grok-shell/src/agent/mvp_agent/session_setup.rs#L1456-L1522).
OAR starts a fresh process, ignores that field, and creates no handle for
previous execution; it retains neither load-time transcript nor replay
cursor. Successful attachment does not establish that an interrupted tool
restarted or an old turn completed. Concurrent same-ID controllers,
cross-process live attachment, and load-fallback code effects remain
**unverified** through OAR.

Native [session fork](https://github.com/xai-org/grok-build/blob/bc7f02e/crates/codegen/xai-grok-shell/src/extensions/session_admin.rs#L994-L1007)
exists as `x.ai/session/fork`; OAR exposes no fork operation.

### Prompting, steering, queuing, and cancellation

Native `session/prompt { sessionId, prompt: [{ type: "text", text }] }`
streams updates and eventually answers the prompt request. Attachment itself
submits no prompt. Native [prompt identity](https://github.com/xai-org/grok-build/blob/bc7f02e/crates/codegen/xai-grok-shell/src/agent/mvp_agent/acp_agent.rs#L1074-L1119)
and [queue/send-now dispatch](https://github.com/xai-org/grok-build/blob/bc7f02e/crates/codegen/xai-grok-shell/src/agent/mvp_agent/acp_agent.rs#L1288-L1343)
are vendor-specific semantics beyond standard ACP.

**Images (mapped, against the advertisement):** grok's `initialize` answers
`promptCapabilities.image: false`, yet an ACP `image` block reaches its model
(grok 1.0.44, 2026-09-29: with `initialize` rewritten to advertise images, a
plain green PNG named `probe.png` with "don't run any tools, just look: what
color fills it?" was answered "Green. The image is a solid bright green
fill.", and the same prompt without the image "NO IMAGE"; allowed tools, grok
instead saved the image under `~/.grok/sessions/` and decoded its pixels in
Python). Hence `capabilities.images: true`; if a later grok refuses image
blocks, the prompt fails with grok's own error and this override goes
([test](../../tests/acp/acp-session-images.test.ts)).

**Prompt (mapped):** `prompt()` records a prompt request and answers it
`accepted` once the `session/prompt` RPC is on the wire (no deadline; cancel
bounds its lifetime), or `rejected` (`busy` while a turn is active; the
transport error when the process is gone). Acceptance never waits for native
acknowledgement. The RPC answer is Grok's own turn end: a frame
`session/prompt` with `native` = the answer, a `turn_ended` event
(`stopReason: "cancelled"` → aborted, else completed) and a `usage` event
from `_meta`. An RPC error answer is a frame `session/prompt/error` with a
failed `turn_ended` (`runtime_exited` when the process died, else the
classified reason). Around each prompt Grok pushes `_x.ai/sessions/changed`
(`working`, then `idle`) and, after `turn_completed`,
`_x.ai/session/prompt_complete` (`promptId`, `stopReason`,
`cancellationCategory`); all are frames with no events.
[Turn machinery](../../packages/oar/src/shared/acp/turns.ts),
[test](../../tests/acp/acp-session.test.ts).

**Steer (mapped; a cancel-and-rerun natively):** `steer()` sends another
`session/prompt` with `_meta.sendNow` inside the same turn (otherwise rejected
`no_active_turn`, reason `not_steerable: no active turn`); each answer is its own frame, and
only the one that leaves no request pending carries `turn_ended`, with the
newest request's outcome. Natively `_meta.sendNow` is **not an injection
into the running model call**: Grok answers the running prompt `stopReason:
"cancelled"` with `_meta.cancelTrigger: "send_now"` and
`cancellationCategory: "MidTurnAbort"` (the vendor `prompt_complete` says the
same), while interrupted terminals keep running to completion (their
`wait_for_exit` answers land afterwards), then starts a fresh model turn that
re-issues the interrupted tool calls under new call ids and answers with the
steered text. OAR folds both answers into the one turn; a steer costs a
re-run of whatever the interrupted call was doing. (`live-contract/steer`;
fixture replay in
[`acp-grok-wire-shapes.test.ts`](../../tests/acp/acp-grok-wire-shapes.test.ts).)

**Queue (mapped):** `queue()` is a host-memory FIFO
(`capabilities.queue.durable: false`), drained one message per turn end; a
drained input runs as a spontaneous turn with an answer but no prompt request
of its own, and held input is dropped once the stream says the runtime is
unreachable (`live-contract/queue`). `withdraw(inputId)` takes an input out
of this FIFO before it is prompted (`accepted`) and answers `not_queued`
after; grok's own `x.ai/queue/remove` is a different queue and stays
unmapped ([input cancellation](input-cancellation.md),
[test](../../tests/acp/acp-session-withdraw.test.ts)).

**Abort (mapped):** `abort()` sends `session/cancel` and answers `accepted`;
the turn's end is still the cancelled prompt answer, which Grok delivers
within about a second (`turn_completed stop_reason: cancelled`,
`prompt_complete cancellationCategory: MidTurnAbort`, then the
`session/prompt` answer with `turn_ended: aborted`). If no answer arrives
within ten seconds, OAR kills the process and the `exited` response is the
turn's end (a `runtime_exited` failure to `awaitTurnEnd`, not an aborted
outcome). A late abort is rejected `no active turn`. Effects on background
children remain **unverified**. (`live-contract/abort`,
`live-contract/busy-and-late-control`.)

**Unreachable runtime:** a `dispose` mid-turn cancels first, so the stream
holds the cancelled answer (`turn_ended: aborted`) before `request dispose`,
`response exited` (code 143 from OAR's SIGTERM after `session/close`). When
Grok dies on its own (SIGKILL), the stream gets `response exited` with
`requestId ""` and code `null` and no turn end from the runtime
(`runtime_exited` for `awaitTurnEnd`); every later
prompt/steer/queue/withdraw/abort is rejected `runtime exited` by the
kernel's reachability gate (read off the
stream, not an adapter flag) and a later `dispose` is answered `accepted`.
(`live-contract/dispose-mid-turn`, `live-contract/kill-runtime`;
[test](../../tests/acp/acp-session.test.ts).)

### Events, history, and child sessions

**Mapped:** a basic one-word turn is 50 records: the handshake answers
`initialize`, `authenticate`, `session/new` (model event); then per prompt
`_x.ai/sessions/changed` (working), several `available_commands_update`
pushes, `session_summary_generated` + `session_info_update` (Grok titles the
session), token-level `agent_thought_chunk` and `agent_message_chunk` (each
with `_meta.eventId`, `promptId`, `totalTokens`, `chunkId`),
`response_completed`, `turn_completed`, `sessions/changed` (idle),
`prompt_complete`, and the `session/prompt` answer (`turn_ended` + `usage`).
`native` is present on every event and seqs are dense
(`live-contract/basic`). Views preserve text, reasoning, tool wire IDs, tool
boundaries, context snapshots, and model reports; detail strings truncate at
10,000 characters but `native` never does. A non-terminal `tool_call_update`
for a known call that carries `rawOutput` is a `tool_call_progress` event
(its `content` is never read as progress). A tool the runtime never ended
gets no synthetic end; the turn's `turn_ended` event is the only closure.
Grok reports no retry through ACP, so `retry` never appears.
[Projection](../../packages/oar/src/shared/acp/projection.ts).

**Two notification methods.** On the wire `session/update` carries only
standard kinds (`available_commands_update`, `session_info_update`,
`agent_thought_chunk`, `agent_message_chunk`, `user_message_chunk`,
`tool_call`, `tool_call_update`), for the root and each child id alike.
`_x.ai/session_notification` is its vendor twin (same envelope
`{sessionId, update: {sessionUpdate: <kind>, …}}`) and carries every
non-standard kind: `model_changed`, `session_summary_generated`,
`tool_call_delta_chunk`, `pending_interaction`, `interaction_resolved`,
`response_completed` (per model call, snake_case usage), `turn_completed`
(per prompt, camelCase usage with `modelCalls` and `costUsdTicks`),
`last_turn_summary`, `background_tasks` (pushed by `session/resume`), and the
sub-agent lifecycle. The split matters because the ACP SDK (1.4.0) client
validates every `session/update` against a closed union of the standard kinds
*before* any handler runs; a vendor kind on that method would be dropped
with an "Error handling notification" line on OAR's stderr. Grok does not do
that; the hazard is latent, not observed. The SDK also routes only
registered notification methods and silently discards the rest, so the
profile subscribes by name to every vendor method Grok is known to emit
(`GROK_EXTENSION_NOTIFICATIONS`): `_x.ai/session_notification`,
`_x.ai/sessions/changed` (the resident session table, `activity:
working|idle`, `removed` on close), `_x.ai/session/prompt_complete`, and the
per-session-start connection housekeeping `_x.ai/queue/changed` (the delivery
queue, with the prompt text), `_x.ai/models/update`, `_x.ai/settings/update`,
`_x.ai/announcements/update`, `_x.ai/mcp/servers_updated`,
`_x.ai/mcp/init_progress`, `_x.ai/mcp/server_status`, `_x.ai/mcp_initialized`.
Still [sym]-only and kept registered: `_x.ai/session/update`,
`_x.ai/task_backgrounded`, `_x.ai/task_completed`, `_x.ai/session/usage`.
An unlisted method is a frame OAR never sees (`grok-wire-tap.ts` shows wire
versus stream; [wire-shape test](../../tests/acp/acp-grok-wire-shapes.test.ts)).

**Children (nested attribution):** native child
[spawn events](https://github.com/xai-org/grok-build/blob/bc7f02e/crates/codegen/xai-grok-shell/src/agent/subagent/handle_request.rs#L609-L634)
identify parent/child sessions and parent prompt; [completion events](https://github.com/xai-org/grok-build/blob/bc7f02e/crates/codegen/xai-grok-shell/src/agent/subagent/spawn.rs#L318-L368)
report status, usage, and whether the parent will wake. On the wire, the
root's `spawn_subagent` tool call produces `subagent_spawned` and
`subagent_progress` frames carrying `update.parent_session_id` /
`update.child_session_id` (snake_case, nested under `update`; also
`subagent_id`, `attempt_id`, `parent_prompt_id`, `subagent_type`, `model`),
while `subagent_finished` names only `child_session_id` (plus `status`,
`output`, `will_wake`), the parent being the envelope's `sessionId`. In
between, the child's own `session/update` frames (`user_message_chunk` with
the delegated prompt, thoughts, `tool_call`, `tool_call_update`, text) arrive
under the child id, and the child's own `response_completed`,
`turn_completed`, `pending_interaction`/`interaction_resolved`,
`tool_call_delta_chunk`, and per-child `_x.ai/queue/changed` /
`_x.ai/mcp_initialized` are vendor frames whose envelope `sessionId` is the
child's. The root's `tool_call_ended` content embeds the child's report plus a
`<subagent_meta>` block.

OAR records `session/update` and vendor frames alike under the session id
their envelope names, so the child's ledgers land under the child and the
parent's `subagent_*` lifecycle under the parent. A vendor frame naming a
parent/child pair, in either spelling (`parent_session_id`/`parentSessionId`)
at either depth (`acpLineageOf`, [records.ts](../../packages/oar/src/shared/acp/records.ts)),
links the graph `via: "tool_call"`; one child spawn yields two nodes and one
edge. A child whose lineage notification was not observed stays a node
without an edge; OAR never fabricates one. There is no child control handle.
(`live-contract/subagent`; [wire-shape
test](../../tests/acp/acp-grok-wire-shapes.test.ts) with fixture
[`fake-acp-grok.mjs`](../../tests/fixtures/fake-acp-grok.mjs).)

**Unsolicited response:** Grok has been seen sending, once per session, a
JSON-RPC *response* with `id: "skills-reload"` matching no request of OAR's
(the SDK logs "Got response to unknown request skills-reload"). It does not
reproduce under the wire tap, so its params are unrecorded; it does not reach
the stream.

**History:** the retained stream backs `rawEvents(observer, cursor)` for the
life of the process; a mid-turn subscribe with `afterSeq` replays exactly the
retained records and continues live; a full replay equals `records()`
(`live-contract/cursor`). There is no native-history enumeration and no
rebuild after the process died.

### Models and instructions

Native model discovery uses `_x.ai/models/list`; model selection uses
`session/set_model`. [OAR listing](../../packages/oar/src/runtimes/grok/list-models.ts)
handles the extra result envelope and filters hidden/unselectable entries
([`grok-list-models.ts`](../../experiments/grok-list-models.ts)). **Mapped:**
open-time model selection applies `session/set_model` after the session
opens, and `model()` folds the runtime's reports: `models.currentModelId`
from `session/new`/`resume`, then the `set_model` answer's `_meta.model` (the
applied id, never the request). A non-existent id is rejected `Invalid
params`, so `session()` throws at open (`live-contract/bad-model`). The
runtime default model is not stable across sessions: with no request from
OAR, `session/new` has reported both `grok-4.6` and `grok-4.5`; a
`model_changed` vendor push precedes the answer and names the same id.
[Model read-back](../../packages/oar/src/shared/acp/model.ts),
[test](../../tests/acp/acp-session-model-usage.test.ts).

**Effort (mapped).** The effort menu is per model. `_x.ai/models/list`
entries carry it under `_meta` ([env] 1.0.41: `supportsReasoningEffort`,
`reasoningEffort` (the default), `reasoningEfforts: [{id, value, label,
description, default}]`; grok-4.7 offers xhigh/high/medium/low, grok-4.5
high/medium/low), and the lister reads it there. The session channel is the
ACP config option `reasoning_effort` in the `thought_level` category, which
`session/new` and `session/resume` advertise. `SessionOptions.effort` is
`session/set_config_option {configId: "reasoning_effort", value}`, sent
after any `set_model` (a model switch re-derives the option's menu for the
new model). grok answers with every option's current value, then pushes
`_x.ai/session_notification {update: {sessionUpdate: "model_changed",
model_id, reasoning_effort}}` and a `config_option_update`; the answer and
the update carry the `effort` event, and a `currentValue` other than the
request refuses the open. An unknown level is refused `-32602 Invalid
params` ("unknown reasoning_effort value"), so the open rejects with that
message. The `--reasoning-effort` flag of `grok agent` does not reach ACP
sessions: with it, `session/new` still reported `high`. grok persists the
level with the session: a resume answers the level last set (live
2026-09-29: `low`), and a resume that asks for none keeps it. The
`_x.ai/sessions/changed` upserts carry `reasoningEffort` too (`low` while
the turn is `working`), recorded verbatim with no event. Live effort
changes are **unexposed** ([native surfaces](live-configure.md)).
[ACP effort channel](../../packages/oar/src/shared/acp/effort.ts),
[test](../../tests/acp/acp-session-effort.test.ts).

Grok's initialization extensions accept system-instruction configuration.
OAR maps `systemPrompt` to `_meta.systemPromptOverride` and
`appendSystemPrompt` to `_meta.rules` on `initialize`; these are Grok
mappings, not standard ACP fields.

### Context usage, billing, and compaction

**Context (partial):** `Session.contextUsage()` reads the prompt answer's
`_meta.totalTokens` (or `contextTokens`), Grok's running context count
(about 16.8k after a one-word turn). No answer carries a window, so
`contextWindow`/`percent` are `null` even though `session/new` advertises
`totalContextTokens: 500000` per model. The count rides the answer itself
(Grok's `response_completed`/`turn_completed` precede it), so the profile
configures no post-answer wait (`usageUpdateAfterPrompt` unset).
[Usage reader](../../packages/oar/src/runtimes/grok/session.ts).

**Billing (mapped):** `Session.usage()` is the sum of the per-prompt
`_meta.usage` ledgers (`inputTokens` including cached reads, `outputTokens`;
a ledger missing either side is ignored rather than half-counted). Each
ledger is what THAT prompt billed, summed over every model call the prompt
caused, not a session total: repeated one-word turns bill about 16.8k input
each; a send-now steer's two answers carry two disjoint ledgers (the
cancelled prompt's one call, 16776/222, then the steering prompt's own two
calls, 34420/279 with `modelCalls: 2`: the re-issued tool round plus the
final answer), so summing both counts nothing twice; and a prompt that
spawned a child bills the child's calls inside its own ledger (53321/355,
`modelCalls: 4` = the parent's two and the child's two `response_completed`
frames, `input_tokens` + `cache_read_input_tokens` each, while the child's
own `turn_completed` reports 19280/96, `modelCalls: 2`). The adapter
therefore accumulates only the root's prompt ledgers and stamps the running
total on each answer's `usage` event; the root's `usage()` already covers
the child's spend. The child's own ledgers (its `response_completed` per
call, its `turn_completed`, and the parent's
`subagent_progress`/`subagent_finished` `tokens_used`) are recorded verbatim
(`native` only, child-envelope ones under the child's session id) and
deliberately NOT folded a second time. (`live-contract/multi-turn`, `steer`,
`subagent`; [wire-shape test](../../tests/acp/acp-grok-wire-shapes.test.ts).)

Native [explicit compaction dispatch](https://github.com/xai-org/grok-build/blob/bc7f02e/crates/codegen/xai-grok-shell/src/agent/mvp_agent/acp_agent.rs#L2561-L2563)
exists through `x.ai/compact_conversation`; automatic compaction remains
native harness behavior. OAR has no typed compaction operation, and no ACP
frame reports one, so Grok sessions never carry `compaction_started` or
`compaction_ended` events.

### Tools, MCP, and permissions

Native ACP supports terminal and permission reverse requests; vendor tools
and configured MCP integrations execute within the harness. **Mapped:** OAR's
[terminal host](../../packages/oar/src/shared/acp/terminal.ts) hosts
terminals, including Grok's full shell-line `command` compatibility. A tool
turn opens with `tool_call` `title: "run_terminal_command"` and `rawInput`
(the shell line), runs through `terminal/create|wait_for_exit|output|release`
reverse requests (four `toApp` records with `answered` responses, terminal
output payloads verbatim), and closes with a `tool_call_update` whose
`rawOutput` is `{type: "Bash", output: [<bytes>], output_for_prompt:
"exit: 0\n…", exit_code: 0, signal: null}` and whose `content` is an ACP
content block holding the same output as text. The `tool_call_ended` event
carries the content block's text as a text part of `content` (the byte array
stays in `native`) and `exit_code` as `exitCode` (`null` for a signal exit);
a closing update without content (`read_file`, `search_replace`) falls back
to `rawOutput` as one `other` part. Under `--always-approve` no
`session/request_permission` arrives, though Grok still pushes
`pending_interaction`/`interaction_resolved` pairs; if one did, the
[client app](../../packages/oar/src/shared/acp/client-app.ts) selects
`allow_always`, then `allow_once`, otherwise `cancelled`, alongside the
launch/session yolo settings.

There is no application approval callback, generic client-tool callback, or
per-session MCP configuration (all **unexposed**). Passing no MCP servers and
disabling client filesystem methods does not disable every vendor-configured
tool.

### Process ownership, release, installation, and account usage

Native ACP advertises session close. **Mapped:** OAR owns the spawned
process; disposal cancels active work, attempts `session/close` when
advertised (2-second deadline), kills its process, and disposes hosted
terminals. On POSIX the process and each hosted terminal command lead their
own process groups, so OAR's signals reach what they started (a shell line's
children too). The runtime gets SIGTERM, then SIGKILL if it is still running
after a grace period (10 s, or `OAR_KILL_GRACE_MS`), so disposal settles even
when Grok ignores SIGTERM ([test](../../tests/session-dispose.test.ts));
hosted terminals are SIGKILLed at release and disposal. A terminal still
pending `terminal/wait_for_exit` at disposal is answered `{exitCode: null,
signal: "SIGKILL"}` *after* the `exited` response (the spec keeps late
facts). Disposal does not delete the persistent native session and supplies
resource release, not detached execution or a lease against other
controllers. The environment overlay applies to the child process and to
hosted terminals.

Installation checks `OAR_GROK_BIN`, PATH, and the official script/npm layouts
(`$GROK_BIN_DIR`, `$GROK_HOME/bin`, `~/.grok/bin`), probing with
`grok agent stdio --help`. [Account usage](../../packages/oar/src/runtimes/grok/account-usage.ts)
separately opens a connection and queries `_x.ai/billing` (plus
`_x.ai/auth/info` for the email). No billing `config` is `unsupported`
`quota_unavailable`; a config that carries none of `creditUsagePercent`,
`used` and `monthlyLimit` reads as zero usage, as grok's own `/usage` shows it
(1.0.46, an unused account; [account usage](../spec/account-usage.md),
[test](../../tests/grok/grok-account-usage-reader.test.ts)). Account quota,
prompt billing, and context occupancy are distinct APIs and measurements.
[Installation](../../packages/oar/src/runtimes/grok/installation.ts).

Grok updates itself by default. Launched from `~/.grok/bin`, as the script
install puts it, `grok agent stdio` (OAR's own launch) checks for a release
and silently repoints the link (a sandboxed 1.0.44 became 1.0.46 within 40
seconds of an idle launch, 2026-10-01), so a grok session can start on a
different version than `installation()` reported. `GROK_DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER=1`
or `[cli] auto_update = false` stop it; an explicit `grok update` ignores
both. **Not mapped:** OAR passes neither, so the user's setting decides.
`checkUpdate` reads `grok update --check --json` and `upgrade` runs
`grok update` ([runtime updates](../spec/update.md)).

## Verification and open gaps

[`experiments/live-contract.ts grok`](../../experiments/live-contract.ts)
covers every promise above on a real SuperGrok login through the public
Session API, from a scratch cwd under `/tmp` (yolo mode edits files), across
the thirteen scenarios cited by name; [`grok-wire-tap.ts`](../../experiments/grok-wire-tap.ts)
compares the raw wire with the stream (which frames reach records; two
notification methods; lineage shape; per-prompt ledgers). The battery's
voyage recorder can write a late record (the post-`exited` terminal answer
above) into the next scenario's log: a recorder hazard, not a stream one.

[ACP session tests](../../tests/acp/acp-session.test.ts) and
[model/usage tests](../../tests/acp/acp-session-model-usage.test.ts) use a fake
agent for the record skeleton of a tool turn, busy/queue behavior, send-now
steer folding, toApp permission records, prompt-error versus process-exit
ends, resume identity, child-session records, extension-notification graph
edges, and model readback. [Grok wire-shape tests](../../tests/acp/acp-grok-wire-shapes.test.ts)
replay the 1.0.25 frames (fixture [`fake-acp-grok.mjs`](../../tests/fixtures/fake-acp-grok.mjs)):
nested snake_case lineage → graph edge, the envelope-parent
`subagent_finished`, never-fabricated lineage, listed versus unlisted vendor
methods, and per-prompt ledgers accumulating into `usage()`. [Terminal tests](../../tests/acp/acp-terminal.test.ts)
cover shell compatibility, truncation, and cleanup. [Snapshot tests](../../tests/acp/acp-vendor-snapshot.test.ts)
check recorded schema assumptions (1.0.5), not execution of the current
harness. The [CI behavior matrix](../../.github/workflows/ci.yml) runs real
Claude, Codex, and Pi backends, not Grok.

Open gaps: grok 1.0.41 pushes `_x.ai/session/setup {method: "session/new",
phase: "model_switch", sessionId}` while opening (seen 2026-09-29 below the
SDK), a vendor method not in `GROK_EXTENSION_NOTIFICATIONS`, so the SDK
drops it before the stream; concurrent children; cancellation with
background children (`will_wake`, `task_backgrounded`, `task_completed`);
usage across compaction; concurrent same-ID controllers, cross-process live
attachment and load-fallback code effects; the `skills-reload` response's
payload; the [sym]-only vendor methods. Design should distinguish restoring
context, replaying observations, and adopting live execution; the Session
OAR returns does not imply all three.
